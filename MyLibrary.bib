  abstract = {With the increasing popularity of plug-in electric vehicles (PEV), charging infrastructure becomes widely available and offers multiple services to PEV users. Each charging service has a distinct quality of service (QoS) level that matches user expectations. The charging service demand is interdependent, i.e., the demand for one service is often affected by the prices of others. Dynamic pricing of charging services is a coordination mechanism for QoS satisfaction of service classes. In this article, we propose a differentiated pricing mechanism for a multiservice PEV charging infrastructure (EVCI). The proposed framework motivates PEV users to avoid over-utilization of particular service classes. Currently, most of dynamic pricing schemes require full knowledge of the customer-side information; however, such information is stochastic, non-stationary, and expensive to collect at scale. Our proposed pricing mechanism utilizes model-free deep reinforcement learning (RL) to learn and improve automatically without an explicit model of the environment. We formulate our framework to adopt the twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) algorithm. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed RL-based differentiated pricing scheme can adaptively adjust service pricing for a multiservice EVCI to maximize charging facility utilization while ensuring service quality satisfaction.},

Customers are seeking to get the lowest price while airlines are trying to keep their overall revenue as high as possible and maximize their profit. Airlines use various kinds of computational techniques to increase their revenue such as demand prediction and price discrimination. From the customer side, two kinds of models are proposed by different researchers to save money for customers: models that predict the optimal time to buy a ticket and models that predict the minimum ticket price. In this paper, we present a review of customer side and airlines side prediction models. Our review analysis shows that models on both sides rely on limited set of features such as historical ticket price data, ticket purchase date and departure date. Features extracted from external factors such as social media data and search engine query are not considered. Therefore, we introduce and discuss the concept of using social media data for ticket/demand prediction.},

  abstract = {Bayesian reinforcement learning provides an elegant solution to addressing the exploration-exploitation trade-off in Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) when the environment’s dynamics and reward function are initially unknown. By maintaining a belief over these unknown components and the state, the agent can effectively learn the environment’s dynamics and optimize their policy. However, scaling Bayesian reinforcement learning methods to large problems remains to be a significant challenge. While prior work has leveraged factored models and online sample-based planning to address this issue, these approaches often retain unnecessarily complex models and factors within the belief space that have minimal impact on the optimal policy. While this complexity might be necessary for accurate model learning, in reinforcement learning, the primary objective is not to recover the ground truth model but to optimize the policy for maximizing the expected sum of rewards. Abstraction offers a way to reduce model complexity by removing factors that are less relevant to achieving high rewards. In this work, we propose and analyze the integration of abstraction with online planning in factored POMDPs. Our empirical results demonstrate two key benefits. First, abstraction reduces model size, enabling faster simulations and thus more planning simulations within a fixed runtime. Second, abstraction enhances performance even with a fixed number of simulations due to greater statistical strength. These results underscore the potential of abstraction to improve both the scalability and effectiveness of Bayesian reinforcement learning in factored POMDPs.},

Consequently even the most privacy aware users are not safe from the threat of re-identification. On the other hand, there are many people who are willing to share their personal information, even when fully conscious of the consequences. A claim from the advocates of open access information is that the preservation of privacy should not be an issue, as people seem to be confortable in a world where their tastes, lifestyle or personality are digitized and publicly available.

The proposed methodology was originated with data processing of Raman spectra of multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) turfs and image enhancement of SEM micrographs. Image analysis techniques of SEM images were employed and stereological relations were determined for SEM images of CNT structures; these results were utilized to estimate the morphology of the turf (i.e. CNTs alignment and curvature) using an artificial neural networks (ANN) classifier. This model was also used to investigate the link between Raman spectra of CNTs and the quality of the turf morphology. This novel methodology will improve our capability to control the quality of the grown nanotubes through the use of this system in a supervised growth environment.},

  abstract = {The transition from internal combustion engines to electric vehicles (EVs) has received significant attention and investment due to its potential in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The integration of EVs into electric and transport systems presents both benefits and challenges in energy management. The scheduling of EV charging can alleviate congestion in the electric system and reduce waiting times for EV owners. The use of renewable energy sources (RESs) for EV charging and supporting the grid can help mitigate the uncertainty of these energy resources. Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology can be used as an alternative approach in the event of sudden high consumption of the grid. Additionally, cost minimization through large-scale coordinated planning is crucial for the future of e-mobility systems. This review paper focuses on the latest trends considering the various approaches and features in coordinated EV scheduling, as well as the influence of different stakeholders, categorized as single- and multiple-charging stations (CS) and aggregator levels. By implementing coordinated EV scheduling, various methods are presented to better manage the needs and satisfaction of EV owners as well as the profit of CS and the market trends of e-mobility systems. In this regard, EV charging strategies considering V2G, uncertainty evaluation of parameters, coordinated charging management, congestion of CSs and electrical lines, route mapping, and technical and economic aspects of the system hierarchy, including consumers, CSs and aggregators, are reviewed and discussed.},

  abstract = {This study summarizes a critical review on EVs’ optimal charging and scheduling under dynamic pricing schemes. A detailed comparison of these schemes, namely, Real Time Pricing (RTP), Time of Use (ToU), Critical Peak Pricing (CPP), and Peak Time Rebates (PTR), is presented. Globally, the intention is to reduce the carbon emissions (CO2) has motivated the extensive practice of Electric Vehicles (EVs). The uncoordinated charging and uncontrolled integration however of EVs to the distribution network deteriorates the system performance in terms of power quality issues. Therefore, the EVs’ charging activity can be coordinated by dynamic electricity pricing, which can influence the charging activities of the EVs customers by offering flexible pricing at different demands. Recently, with developments in technology and control schemes, the RTP scheme offers more promise compared to the other types of tariff because of the greater flexibility for EVs’ customers to adjust their demands. It however involves higher degree of billing instability, which may influence the customer’s confidence. In addition, the RTP scheme needs a robust intelligent automation system to improve the customer’s feedback to time varying prices. In addition, the review covers the main optimization methods employed in a dynamic pricing environment to achieve objectives such as power loss and electricity cost minimization, peak load reduction, voltage regulation, distribution infrastructure overloading minimization, etc.},

  abstract = {Model-based reinforcement learning has proven highly successful. However, learning a model in isolation from its use during planning is problematic in complex environments. To date, the most effective techniques have instead combined value-equivalent model learning with powerful tree-search methods. This approach is exemplified by MuZero, which has achieved state-of-the-art performance in a wide range of domains, from board games to visually rich environments, with discrete and continuous action spaces, in online and offline settings. However, previous instantiations of this approach were limited to the use of deterministic models. This limits their performance in environments that are inherently stochastic, partially observed, or so large and complex that they appear stochastic to a finite agent. In this paper we extend this approach to learn and plan with stochastic models. Specifically, we introduce a new algorithm, Stochastic MuZero, that learns a stochastic model incorporating afterstates, and uses this model to perform a stochastic tree search. Stochastic MuZero matched or exceeded the state of the art in a set of canonical single and multi-agent environments, including 2048 and backgammon, while maintaining the same performance as standard MuZero in the game of Go.},

  abstract = {Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) can model complex sequential decision-making problems under stochastic and uncertain environments. A main reason hindering their broad adoption in real-world applications is the lack of availability of a suitable POMDP model or a simulator thereof. Available solution algorithms, such as Reinforcement Learning (RL), require the knowledge of the transition dynamics and the observation generating process, which are often unknown and non-trivial to infer. In this work, we propose a combined framework for inference and robust solution of POMDPs via deep RL. First, all transition and observation model parameters are jointly inferred via Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling of a hidden Markov model, which is conditioned on actions, in order to recover full posterior distributions from the available data. The POMDP with uncertain parameters is then solved via deep RL techniques with the parameter distributions incorporated into the solution via domain randomization, in order to develop solutions that are robust to model uncertainty. As a further contribution, we compare the use of transformers and long short-term memory networks, which constitute model-free RL solutions, with a model-based/model-free hybrid approach. We apply these methods to the real-world problem of optimal maintenance planning for railway assets.},

Unlike most current approaches to control EV charging, which construct optimal charging schedules by predicting EV state of charge and future behaviour, we leverage the anticipated widespread deployment of measurement and control points to propose an alternative vision. In our approach, drawing from a comparative analysis of Internet and distribution grid congestion, control actions taken by a charger every few milliseconds in response to congestion signals allow it to rapidly reduce its charging rate to avoid grid congestion. We sketch three control schemes that embody this vision and compare their relative merits and demerits.},

Instead of upgrading components to higher nameplate ratings, we investigate the use of real-time control to limit EV load to the available capacity in the network. Inspired by rate control algorithms in computer networks such as TCP, we design a measurement-based, real-time, distributed, stable, efficient, and fair charging algorithm using the dual-decomposition approach. We show through extensive numerical simulations and power flow analysis on a test distribution network that this algorithm operates successfully in both static and dynamic settings, despite changes in home loads and the number of connected EVs. We find that our algorithm rapidly converges from large disturbances to a stable operating point. We show that in a test setting, for an acceptable level of overload, only 70 EVs could be fully charged without control, whereas up to around 700 EVs can be fully charged using our control algorithm. This compares well with the maximum supportable population of approximately 900 EVs. Our work also provides engineering guidelines for choosing the control parameters and setpoints in a distribution network.},

A popular measure of a policy's success in addressing this dilemma is the regret, that is the loss due to the fact that the globally optimal policy is not followed all the times. One of the simplest examples of the exploration/exploitation dilemma is the multi-armed bandit problem. Lai and Robbins were the first ones to show that the regret for this problem has to grow at least logarithmically in the number of plays. Since then, policies which asymptotically achieve this regret have been devised by Lai and Robbins and many others. In this work we show that the optimal logarithmic regret is also achievable uniformly over time, with simple and efficient policies, and for all reward distributions with bounded support.},

  abstract = {Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) are used to model environments where the full state cannot be perceived by an agent. As such the agent needs to reason taking into account the past observations and actions. However, simply remembering the full history is generally intractable due to the exponential growth in the history space. Maintaining a probability distribution that models the belief over what the true state is can be used as a sufficient statistic of the history, but its computation requires access to the model of the environment and is often intractable. While SOTA algorithms use Recurrent Neural Networks to compress the observation-action history aiming to learn a sufficient statistic, they lack guarantees of success and can lead to sub-optimal policies. To overcome this, we propose the Wasserstein Belief Updater, an RL algorithm that learns a latent model of the POMDP and an approximation of the belief update. Our approach comes with theoretical guarantees on the quality of our approximation ensuring that our outputted beliefs allow for learning the optimal value function.},

We show that this impossibility holds even for randomized mechanisms and even if the set of possible distributions is very small or when the seller has a prior distribution over the candidate distributions. On the positive side, we devise a simple posted-price mechanism that guarantees a constant fraction of the known-distribution revenue when all candidate distributions exhibit the monotone hazard rate property.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a spatial and temporal model of electric vehicle charging demand for a rapid charging station located near a highway exit. Most previous studies have assumed a fixed charging location and fixed charging time during the off-peak hours for anticipating electric vehicle charging demand. Some other studies have based on limited charging scenarios at typical locations instead of a mathematical model. Therefore, from a distribution system perspective, electric vehicle charging demand is still unidentified quantity which may vary by space and time. In this context, this study proposes a mathematical model of electric vehicle charging demand for a rapid charging station. The mathematical model is based on the fluid dynamic traffic model and the M/M/s queueing theory. Firstly, the arrival rate of discharged vehicles at a charging station is predicted by the fluid dynamic model. Then, charging demand is forecasted by the M/M/s queueing theory with the arrival rate of discharged vehicles. This mathematical model of charging demand may allow grid's distribution planners to anticipate a charging demand profile at a charging station. A numerical example shows that the proposed model is able to capture the spatial and temporal dynamics of charging demand in a highway charging station.},

  abstract = {Yield management is the dynamic pricing, overbooking, and allocation of perishable assets across market segments in an effort to maximize short-term revenues for the firm. Numerous optimization heuristics for allocation and overbooking exist for the airline industry, whose perishable asset is the airplane seat. When an airplane departs, no revenue is gained from the empty seat(s). In the hotel industry, the perishable asset is the hotel room-once a room is left empty for a night, that night's revenue cannot be recaptured. The literature on yield management heuristics for the hotel industry is sparse. For the hotel operating environment, no research has adequately (1) integrated overbooking with allocation, (2) modeled the phenomenon of hotel patrons extending or contracting their stay at a moment's notice, or (3) performed a realistic performance comparison of alternative heuristics. This research develops (1) two hotel-specific algorithms that both integrate overbooking with the allocation decisions, (2) a simulation model to reproduce realistic hotel operating environments, and (3) compares the performance of five heuristics under 36 realistic hotel operating environments. Seven conclusions are reached with regard to which heuristic(s) perform best in specific operating environments. Generally, heuristic selection is very much dependent on the hotel operating environment. A counterintuitive result is that in many operating environments, the simpler heuristics work as well as the more complex ones.},

  abstract = {The accelerated adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) necessitates innovative and effective pricing strategies for charging infrastructure. This study leverages the MATSim (Multi-Agent Transport Simulation) framework to meticulously evaluate the performance of two distinctive EV charging pricing models: time-based charging and a hybrid model integrating both usage-based and time-based components. Driven by the pivotal question of how EV charging should be optimally priced—whether contingent on energy consumption or charging duration—the research endeavors to conduct two simulations. These simulations aim to provide a comprehensive comparative analysis, evaluating metrics such as total power derived from grids, utility revenue, charging station queues and served vehicles. In the time-based charging scenario, EVs incur charges based on their plugged-in duration, reflecting a pricing approach that correlates directly with the time a vehicle remains connected to the charging station. In contrast, in the hybrid model, EVs undergo initial billing based on usage until a predetermined battery charge point is reached, such as achieving a full battery. Subsequently, time-based pricing takes effect until the user disconnects the vehicle. The findings indicate that, in the combined approach, utility owners have the potential to generate more revenue. Conversely, the time-based approach demonstrates a capacity to serve a higher number of electric EVs, with comparable queue lengths observed in both approaches. Importantly, using the results of this paper, policymakers can suggest pricing schemes that maximize benefits for utility owners, reduce queues at charging stations, and ensure the security of power grids.},

From a privacy perspective behavior-based tracking is even more dangerous, because it allows service providers to track users passively, i. e., without cookies. In this case multiple sessions of a user are linked by exploiting characteristic patterns mined from network traffic. In this paper we study the feasibility of behavior-based tracking in a real-world setting, which is unknown so far. In principle, behavior-based tracking can be carried out by any attacker that can observe the activities of users on the Internet. We design and implement a behavior-based tracking technique that consists of a Naive Bayes classifier supported by a cosine similarity decision engine. We evaluate our technique using a large-scale dataset that contains all queries received by a DNS resolver that is used by more than 2100 concurrent users on average per day. Our technique is able to correctly link 88.2 \% of the surfing sessions on a day-to-day basis. We also discuss various countermeasures that reduce the effectiveness of our technique.},

A viable solution to circumvent the intermittent behavior of renewables is the usage of energy-storage systems. In this paper, we study the energy management of a proof-of-concept system consisting of solar panels, energy-storage systems, a power grid, and household loads. Using neural networks, we identify the most relevant parameters impacting the power generation of solar panels, and then train the corresponding network to derive forecasts. We also go one step further, and propose a heuristics-based energy-management policy for the purpose of reducing curtailments. We show that our proposed policy outperforms the naive policy by 8 \%, which does not consider any power-generation forecasts.},

  abstract = {Forecasting renewable energy sources is of critical importance to several practical applications in the energy field. However, due to the inherent volatile nature of these energy sources, doing so remains challenging. Numerous time-series methods have been explored in literature, which consider only one specific type of renewables (e.g., solar or wind), and are suited to small-scale (micro-level) deployments. In this paper, the different types of renewable energy sources are reflected, which are distributed at a national level (macro-level). To generate accurate predictions, a methodology is proposed, which consists of two main phases. In the first phase, the most relevant variables having impact on the generation of the renewables are identified using correlation analysis. The second phase consists of (1) estimating model parameters, (2) optimising and reducing the number of generated models, and (3) selecting the best model for the method under study. To this end, the three most-relevant time-series auto-regression based methods of SARIMAX, SARIMA, and ARIMAX are considered. After deriving the best model for each method, then a comparison is carried out between them by taking into account different months of the year. The evaluation results illustrate that our forecasts have mean absolute error rates between 6.76 and 11.57\%, while considering both inter- and intra-day scenarios. The best models are implemented in an open-source REN4Kast software platform.},

With those innovations on the rise, reservation of charging stations for electric vehicles will play a pivotal role in seamlessly integrating them into the transportation and mobility system. In this paper we derive basic requirements for building interoperable reservation systems and identify four generic approaches to reservation. For designing the system model and engineering the charging station reservation system, we utilize the E-Mobility Systems Architecture framework. For one of the reservation types, we implement a proof-of-concept and demonstrate its usefulness by conducting a showcase in Bavaria, Germany. Further, we set up and conduct a simulation-based evaluation to compare the four different reservation types regarding their benefit to users and providers as well as overall system efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first contribution proposing an interoperable reservation system for electric vehicle charging. The results presented in this paper provide insights regarding the feasibility of the different reservation types under varying conditions.},

  abstract = {The combination of solar panels (PV) with energy storage systems (ESS) has been becoming more and more a common practice for households. In this context, the battery of ESS satisfies the needs of the household when PV generation is not present. Recently, dynamic pricing became one of the measures taken to shift the demand. Thanks to technological advances (e.g., smart meters), real-time pricing (RTP) has shown to be the most attractive option in the market, due to the ease of estimating price elasticity over various time periods. We studied a PV-battery system for the case of households which are under RTP scheme. To this end, we described and modeled the underlying system, and compiled an objective function having as an optimization goal, the minimization of the charging cost of the battery. Furthermore, we propose a heuristics-based algorithm that schedules the charging process during cheap periods. To evaluate the amount of savings, we considered a real-life testbed and implemented the proposed algorithm by taking into account different scenarios. The results demonstrate the benefits of households adhering to real-time pricing scheme, where the savings reached 50\% in certain cases.},

  abstract = {Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) is a mechanism adopted by major hardware vendors to reduce power demand during times of low processor utilization. However, reducing processor frequency to decrease power demand usually results in degraded services' performance leading to service level agreement violations. Governors, which are a piece of software at kernel level, are devised to exploit the flexibility provided by DVFS technologies of the hardware. Utilization-based governors change frequency and voltage at discrete time instances based on workload's utilization without taking into account performance constraints of services. In this paper, a model for the utilization-based Conservative governor is proposed. The model allows us to predict both service performance (mean response time) and processor power demand. An M/M/1 simulator is presented which is used to validate the accuracy of the proposed model. For model accuracy validation, a second methodology based on the frequency probabilities of the processor is proposed. Both approaches confirm the derived DTMC model. We also carry out a comparison between On-demand and Conservative governors and show that the latter performs better for Markovian workloads.},

These challenges decrease the electric vehicle users\&rsquo; satisfaction and lower the profits of infrastructure providers. Reservation systems can mitigate these issues. We introduce a reference architecture for interoperable reservation systems. The advantages of the proposed architecture are: it (1) considers the needs of the most relevant electric mobility stakeholders, (2) satisfies the interoperability requirements of existing technological heterogeneity, and (3) provides a classification of reservation types based on a morphological methodology. We instantiate the reference architecture and verify its interoperability and fulfillment of stakeholder requirements. Further, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept by instantiating and implementing an ad-hoc reservation approach. Our validation was based on simulations of real-world case studies for various reservation deployments in the Netherlands. We conclude that, in certain high demand situations, reservations can save significant time for electric vehicle trips.

Bayesian games are notable because they allowed, for the first time in game theory, for the specification of the solutions to games with incomplete information. Hungarian economist John C. Harsanyi introduced the concept of Bayesian games in three papers from 1967 and 1968: He was awarded the Nobel Prize for these and other contributions to game theory in 1994. Roughly speaking, Harsanyi defined Bayesian games in the following way: players are assigned by nature at the start of the game a set of characteristics. By mapping probability distributions to these characteristics and by calculating the outcome of the game using Bayesian probability, the result is a game whose solution is, for technical reasons, far easier to calculate than a similar game in a non-Bayesian context. For those technical reasons, see the Specification of games section in this article.},

  abstract = {In order to increase the penetration of electric vehicles, a network of fast charging stations that can provide drivers with a certain level of quality of service (QoS) is needed. However, given the strain that such a network can exert on the power grid, and the mobility of loads represented by electric vehicles, operating it efficiently is a challenging and complex problem. In this paper, we examine a network of charging stations equipped with an energy storage device and propose a scheme that allocates power to them from the grid, as well as routes customers. We examine three scenarios, gradually increasing their complexity. In the first one, all stations have identical charging capabilities and energy storage devices, draw constant power from the grid and no routing decisions of customers are considered. It represents the current state of affairs and serves as a baseline for evaluating the performance of the proposed scheme. In the second scenario, power to the stations is allocated in an optimal manner from the grid and in addition a certain percentage of customers can be routed to nearby stations. In the final scenario, optimal allocation of both power from the grid and customers to stations is considered. The three scenarios are evaluated using real traffic traces corresponding to weekday rush hour from a large metropolitan area in the US. The results indicate that the proposed scheme offers substantial improvements of performance compared to the current mode of operation; namely, more customers can be served with the same amount of power, thus enabling the station operators to increase their profitability. Further, the scheme provides guarantees to customers in terms of the probability of being blocked (and hence not served) by the closest charging station to their location. Overall, the paper addresses key issues related to the efficient operation, both from the perspective of the power grid and the drivers satisfaction, of a network of charging stations.},

To this end, we explore the southern Italian market since it is less accessible by other transport modes and thus fares are the direct outcome of air-related competition. We show, in fact, that market power matters, depending on the level of intra-modal competition, and that airlines apply differentiated mark-ups. Besides, consistent with the implementation of inter-temporal price discrimination (IPD), we find a non-monotonic inter-temporal profile of fares with a turning point included in the interval of the 43rd to 45th days before departure. Finally, we provide evidence that in more competitive markets, airlines are more likely to engage in IPD. (JEL L11, L13, L93)},

DRA problems are notoriously difficult to solve to optimality since they frequently combine stochastic elements with intractably large state and action spaces. Although the artificial intelligence and operations research communities have independently proposed two successful frameworks for solving dynamic stochastic optimization problems—Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) and mathematical optimization (MO), respectively—the relative merits of these two approaches are not well understood. In this paper, we adapt both MCTS and MO to a problem inspired by tactical wildfire and management and undertake an extensive computational study comparing the two methods on large scale instances in terms of both the state and the action spaces. We show that both methods are able to greatly improve on a baseline, problem-specific heuristic. On smaller instances, the MCTS and MO approaches perform comparably, but the MO approach outperforms MCTS as the size of the problem increases for a fixed computational budget.},

The data suggests that there is generally a demand peak on workday mornings and a second peak over a longer time in the afternoon. On weekends, the demand peaks shift towards the night. On the supply side, drivers seem to adapt to the demand peaks very efficiently, with fewer taxis being available at times of low demand, such as during midday. A spatial analysis shows that most taxi trips take place either within the city centre or from/to Tegel Airport, the city's largest single origin and destination. Drivers spend a large amount of their work time on waiting for customers and the taxi rank at Tegel Airport is the most popular one.},

  abstract = {Vehicle parking resource provisioning in major cities and urban areas has gradually become a challenging issue in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) due to the upward trend in car ownership rates. Besides, the increasing attractiveness of Autonomous Electric Vehicle (AEV) technologies complicates the parking problem as self-parking and EV-charging solutions need to be integrated into existing parking infrastructure. Dynamic pricing and reservation-based automated parking and charging are envisioned to accommodate the increasing demand for parking and EV-charging services. This will minimize traffic congestion and enhance road safety. This paper proposes a novel intelligent framework based on dynamic pricing and in-advance parking and charging reservations for Automated Valet Parking and Charging (AVPC) scenarios. We formulate the dynamic pricing problem between a Parking Lot Manager (PLM) and multiple Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) as a two-stage Stackelberg game in which the PLM, as the leader, sets its service price in the first stage to maximize its utility, and each AV, as a follower, determines its service demand in the second stage to maximize its utility. Then, we theoretically prove the existence and uniqueness of the Stackelberg Equilibrium (SE). Considering the stochastic nature of the parking traffic, we transform the game-based optimization problem into a Multi-Agent Markov Decision Process (MAMDP) and propose a Stackelberg Game-aided Multi-Agent Dueling Deep Q-Network (SG-MADDQN) algorithm to solve the problem. Comprehensive simulation results and analysis prove that the proposed algorithm achieves convergence and can best balance the pricing and demand strategies of the PLM and AVs compared with existing solutions.},

  abstract = {A central problem in artificial intelligence is to choose actions to maximize reward in a partially observable, uncertain environment. To do so, we must learn an accurate environment model, and then plan to maximize reward. Unfortunately, learning algorithms often recover a model that is too inaccurate to support planning or too large and complex for planning to succeed; or they require excessive prior domain knowledge or fail to provide guarantees such as statistical consistency. To address this gap, we propose a novel algorithm which provably learns a compact, accurate model directly from sequences of action-observation pairs. We then evaluate the learner by closing the loop from observations to actions. In more detail, we present a spectral algorithm for learning a predictive state representation (PSR), and evaluate it in a simulated, vision-based mobile robot planning task, showing that the learned PSR captures the essential features of the environment and enables successful and efficient planning. Our algorithm has several benefits which have not appeared together in any previous PSR learner: it is computationally efficient and statistically consistent; it handles high-dimensional observations and long time horizons; and, our close-the-loop experiments provide an end-to-end practical test.},

  abstract = {We study dispersion in the prices an airline charges to different passengers on the same route. This variation in fares is substantial: the expected absolute difference in fares between two passengers on a route is 36 percent of the airline's average ticket price. The pattern of observed price dispersion cannot easily be explained by cost differences alone. Dispersion increases on routes with more competition or lower flight density, consistent with discrimination based on customers' willingness to switch to alternative airlines or flights. We argue that the data support models of price discrimination in monopolistically competitive markets.},

  abstract = {In this monograph, we present an overview and analysis of the possible approaches to bringing an active demand side into electricity markets. In section I, we describe the ways in which economic incentives can be introduced on the demand side. We discuss the fundamental economics of establishing these incentives and the economic loss from systems that lack demand-side participation, and we analyze the effect of these incentives on the efficiency and competitiveness of the market. In section II, we move from the fundamentals to specific issues of implementing time-varying prices. We begin by describing illustrative Realtime Pricing and Critical Peak Pricing tariffs that are in use today. We then address the actual development of dynamic retail prices. In section III, we examine the ways in which customers respond to time-varying and dynamic prices. We discuss both the potential responses that are envisioned by those who study optimization of power use and the actual responses that have taken place in pilot and long-term programs. We conclude in section IV by advocating much wider use of dynamic retail pricing, under which prices faced by end-use customers can be adjusted frequently and on short notice to reflect changes in wholesale prices and the supply/demand balance.},

Economic efficiency gains from RTP, however, are often confused with the short-term wealth transfers from producers to consumers that RTP can create. Abstracting f rom transfers, I focus on the long-run efficiency gains from adopting RTP in a competitive electricity market. Using simple simulations with realistic parameters, I demonstrate that the magnitude of efficiency gains from RTP is likely to be significant even if demand shows very little elasticity. I also show that "time-of-use" pricing, a simple peak and off-peak pricing system, is likely to capture a very small share of the efficiency gains that RTP offers.]},

  abstract = {Accurate size measurement during nanoparticle production is essential for the continuing innovation, quality and safety of nano-enabled products. Size measurement by analysing a number of separate particles individually has particular advantages over ensemble methods. In the latter case nanoparticles have to be well dispersed in a fluid and changes that may occur during analysis, such as agglomeration and degradation, will not be detected which could lead to misleading results. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) allows imaging of particles both in air and liquid, however, the strong interactions between the probe and the particle will cause the broadening of the lateral dimension in the final image. In this paper a new procedure to measure the size of spherical nanoparticles from AFM images via vertical height measurement is described. This procedure will quickly analyse hundred of particles simultaneously and reproduce the measurements obtained from electron microscopy (EM). Nanoparticles samples that were difficult, if not impossible, to analyse with EM were successfully measured using this method. The combination of this procedure with the use of a metrological AFM moves closer to true traceable measurements of nanoparticle dispersions.},

  abstract = {The Euclidean k-Steiner tree problem asks for a minimum-cost network connecting n given points in the plane, allowing at most k additional nodes referred to as Steiner points. In the classical Steiner tree problem in which there is no restriction on the number of nodes, every Steiner point must be of degree 3. The k-Steiner problem differs in that Steiner points of degree 4 may be included in an optimal solution. This simple change leads to a number of complexities when attempting to create a generation algorithm for optimal k-Steiner trees, which has proven to be a powerful component of the flagship algorithm, namely GeoSteiner, for solving the classical Steiner tree problem. In the present paper we firstly extend the basic framework of GeoSteiner's generation algorithm to include degree-4 Steiner points. We then introduce a number of novel results restricting the structural and geometric properties of optimal k-Steiner trees, and then show how these properties may be used as topological pruning methods underpinning our generation algorithm. Finally, we present experimental data to show the effectiveness of our pruning methods in reducing the number of sub-optimal solution topologies.},

  abstract = {Sharing economy firms such as Uber and Airbnb facilitate trusted transactions between strangers on digital platforms. This creates economic and other value and raises a set of concerns around racial bias, safety, and fairness to competitors and workers that legal scholarship has begun to address. Missing from the literature, however, is a fundamental critique of the sharing economy grounded in asymmetries of information and power. This Article, coauthored by a law professor and a technology ethnographer who studies the ride-hailing community, furnishes such a critique and indicates a path toward a meaningful response.Commercial firms have long used what they know about consumers to shape their behavior and maximize profits. By virtue of sitting between consumers and providers of services, however, sharing economy firms have a unique capacity to monitor and nudge all participants — including people whose livelihood may depend on the platform. Much activity is hidden away from view, but preliminary evidence suggests that sharing economy firms may already be leveraging their access to information about users and their control over the user experience to mislead, coerce, or otherwise disadvantage sharing economy participants.This Article argues that consumer protection law, with its longtime emphasis of asymmetries of information and power, is relatively well positioned to address this under-examined aspect of the sharing economy. But the regulatory response to date seems outdated and superficial. To be effective, legal interventions must (1) reflect a deeper understanding of the acts and practices of digital platforms and (2) interrupt the incentives of sharing economy firms to abuse their position.},

  abstract = {Robots operating in real-world environments must reason about possible outcomes of stochastic actions and make decisions based on partial observations of the true world state. A major challenge for making accurate and robust action predictions is the problem of confounding, which if left untreated can lead to prediction errors. The partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) is a widely-used framework to model these stochastic and partially-observable decision-making problems. However, due to a lack of explicit causal semantics, POMDP planning methods are prone to confounding bias and thus in the presence of unobserved confounders may produce underperforming policies. This paper presents a novel causally-informed extension of “anytime regularized determinized sparse partially observable tree” (AR-DESPOT), a modern anytime online POMDP planner, using causal modelling and inference to eliminate errors caused by unmeasured confounder variables. We further propose a method to learn offline the partial parameterisation of the causal model for planning, from ground truth model data. We evaluate our methods on a toy problem with an unobserved confounder and show that the learned causal model is highly accurate, while our planning method is more robust to confounding and produces overall higher performing policies than AR-DESPOT.},

Heavy intermittent charging load of EVs will create bottlenecks in supplying capacity and expose power system to severe security risks. In this paper, we propose an intelligent method to control EV charging loads in response to time-of-use (TOU) price in a regulated market. First, an optimized charging model is formulated to minimize the charging cost. Then, a heuristic method is implemented to minimize the charging cost considering the relation between the acceptable charging power of EV battery and the state of charge (SOC). Finally, the charging cost and energy demand in different time intervals are compared for both typical charging pattern and optimized charging pattern. Results show that the optimized charging pattern has great benefit in reducing cost and flatting the load curve if the peak and valley time periods are partitioned appropriately.},

  abstract = {Currently, there is an increasing demand for user-adaptive systems for various purposes in many different domains. Typically, personalisation in information systems occurs separately within each system. The recent trends in user modeling rely on cross-system personalisation, i.e., the opportunity to share information across multiple information systems in order to improve user adaptation. Cooperation among systems in order to exchange user model knowledge is a complex task. This paper addresses a key challenge for cross-system personalisation which is often taken as a starting assumption, i.e., user identification. In this paper, we describe the conceptualization and implementation of a framework that provides a common base for user identification for cross-system personalisation among web-based user-adaptive systems. However, the framework can be easily adopted in different working environments and for different purposes. The framework represents a hybrid approach which draws parallels both from centralized and decentralized solutions for user modeling. To perform user identification, we propose to exploit a set of identification properties that are combined using an identification algorithm.},

  abstract = {We propose an optimal allocation and reservation system for Electric Vehicles (EVs) at charging stations distributed in an urban environment. The system assigns and reserves an optimal space at a charging station based on the user's cost function that combines proximity to current location (or destination) and charging cost. Our approach is motivated by a similar system we have developed for “smart parking”, where resources are parking spaces rather than EV charging station spaces. We solve a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) problem at each assignment decision point over time. The solution of each MILP is an optimal allocation based on current state information, and is updated at the next decision point. Formal guarantees are included that there is no resource reservation conflict and that no user is ever assigned a resource with a higher than this user's current cost function value. Simulation results are included to illustrate how our system, compared to uncontrolled processes or guidance-based approaches, reduces the average time to find a charging space and the associated user cost, while the overall charging space capacity is more efficiently utilized.},

  abstract = {Electric vehicle (EV) charging may impose a substantial power demand on existing low voltage (LV) and medium voltage (MV) networks, which are usually not prepared for high power demands in short time intervals. The influx of E-mobility may require an increase in grid reinforcements, but these can be reduced and optimized by a combination of new technologies, tools, and strategies, such as the deployment of solar PV generation integrated with aggregated energy storage systems. One of the challenges in the implementation of charging infrastructures in public stations is coupling the projected sizes of energy demand and power requirements in each location for each charger. This paper describes a method to estimate projected values for energy consumption and power demand in EV fast charging stations (CS). The proposed ideas were applied in a concept facility located in Campinas, Brazil, in a structure equipped with two 50 kW DC Fast Chargers, local 12.5 kW/13.2 kWp PV generation (to reduce energy impacts to the grid), and a 100 kW/200 kWh storage system, using electrochemical batteries (to minimize peak power requirements).},

  abstract = {The electrification of transportation is a growing strategy to reduce mobile source emissions and air pollution globally. To encourage adoption of electric vehicles, there is a need for reliable evidence about pricing in pub-lic charging stations that can serve a greater number of communities. However, user-entered pricing information by thousands of charge point operators (CPOs) has created ambiguity for large-scale aggregation, increasing both the cost of analysis for researchers and search costs for consumers. In this paper, we use large language models to address standing challenges with price discovery in distributed digital data. We show that generative AI models can effectively extract pricing mechanisms from unstructured text with high accuracy, and at substantially lower cost of three to four orders of magnitude lower than human curation (USD 0.006 pennies per observation). We exploit the few-shot learning capabilities of GPT-4 with human-in-the-loop feedback—beating prior classification performance benchmarks with fewer training data. The most common pricing models include free, energy-based (per kWh), and time-based (per unit time), with tiered pricing (variable pricing based on usage) being the most prevalent among paid stations. Behavioral insights from a US nationally representative sample of 13,008 stations suggest that EV users are commonly frustrated with the slower than expected charging rates and the total cost of charging. This study uncovers additional consumer barriers to charging services concerning the need for better price standardization.},

  abstract = {We study the classic mathematical economics problem of Bayesian optimal mechanism design where a principal aims to optimize expected revenue when allocating resources to self-interested agents with preferences drawn from a known distribution. In single parameter settings (i.e., where each agent's preference is given by a single private value for being served and zero for not being served) this problem is solved [20]. Unfortunately, these single parameter optimal mechanisms are impractical and rarely employed [1], and furthermore the underlying economic theory fails to generalize to the important, relevant, and unsolved multi-dimensional setting (i.e., where each agent's preference is given by multiple values for each of the multiple services available) [25]. In contrast to the theory of optimal mechanisms we develop a theory of sequential posted price mechanisms, where agents in sequence are offered take-it-or-leave-it prices. We prove that these mechanisms are approximately optimal in single-dimensional settings. These posted-price mechanisms avoid many of the properties of optimal mechanisms that make the latter impractical. Furthermore, these mechanisms generalize naturally to multi-dimensional settings where they give the first known approximations to the elusive optimal multi-dimensional mechanism design problem. In particular, we solve multi-dimensional multi-unit auction problems and generalizations to matroid feasibility constraints. The constant approximations we obtain range from 1.5 to 8. For all but one case, our posted price sequences can be computed in polynomial time. This work can be viewed as an extension and improvement of the single-agent algorithmic pricing work of [9] to the setting of multiple agents where the designer has combinatorial feasibility constraints on which agents can simultaneously obtain each service.},

Most of the existing approaches cluster web users based on the snapshots of web usage data, although web usage data are evolutionary in the nature. Consequently, the usefulness of the knowledge discovered by existing web user clustering approaches might be limited. In this paper, we address this problem by clustering web users based on the evolution of web usage data. Given a set of web users and their associated historical web usage data, we study how their usage data change over time and mine evolutionary patterns from each user’s usage history. The discovered patterns capture the characteristics of changes to a web user’s information needs. We can then cluster web users by analyzing common and similar evolutionary patterns shared by users. Web user clusters generated in this way provide novel and useful knowledge for various personalized web applications, including web advertisement and web caching.},

  abstract = {The high penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) will burden the existing power delivery infrastructure if their charging and discharging are not adequately coordinated. Dynamic pricing is a special form of demand response that can encourage EV owners to participate in scheduling programs. Therefore, EV charging and discharging scheduling and its dynamic pricing model are important fields of study. Many researchers have focused on artificial intelligence-based EV charging demand forecasting and scheduling models and suggested that artificial intelligence techniques perform better than conventional optimization methods such as linear, exponential, and multinomial logit models. However, only a few research studies focused on EV discharging scheduling (i.e., vehicle-to-grid, V2G) because the concept of EV discharging electricity back to the power grid is relatively new and evolving. Therefore, a review of existing EV charging and discharging-related studies is needed to understand the research gaps and to make some improvements in future studies. This paper reviews EV charging and discharging-related studies and classifies them into forecasting, scheduling, and pricing mechanisms. The paper determines the linkage between forecasting, scheduling, and pricing mechanism and identifies the research gaps in EV discharging scheduling and dynamic pricing models.},

Travel websites and large, well known e-retailers have already adopted algorithmic pricing strategies, but the tools and techniques are now available to small-scale sellers as well. While algorithmic pricing can make merchants more competitive, it also creates new challenges. Examples have emerged of cases where competing pieces of algorithmic pricing software interacted in unexpected ways and produced unpredictable prices, as well as cases where algorithms were intentionally designed to implement price fixing. Unfortunately, the public currently lack comprehensive knowledge about the prevalence and behavior of algorithmic pricing algorithms in-the-wild. In this study, we develop a methodology for detecting algorithmic pricing, and use it empirically to analyze their prevalence and behavior on Amazon Marketplace. We gather four months of data covering all merchants selling any of 1,641 best-seller products. Using this dataset, we are able to uncover the algorithmic pricing strategies adopted by over 500 sellers.

  abstract = {Electric vehicles (EVs), as popular transportation carriers and flexible electric loads, couple both the power distribution networks and transportation networks. The pricing schemes of fast charging stations significantly affects the EVs’ on-tirp charging behaviors and the operations of coupled power and transportation networks. This interdisciplinary paper proposes an optimal dynamic pricing method for fast charging stations to boost charging network operator’ (CNO’s) profits and avoid excessive charging costs of EVs. Time-varying traffic flow and charging demands are generated by a dynamic traffic assignment simulation, where a boundedly rational dynamic user equilibrium model is presented to capture the cost sensitivity of EVs and gasoline vehicle users. Additionally, a market regulator supervises the CNO’s pricing, balancing the interests of the CNO and users via a regulation constraint. To address the optimal dynamic pricing issue, we propose a three-level Stackelberg game involving the distribution network operator, CNO, and users. The existence of a game equilibrium is assured by the fixed-point theory. A Gauss-Seidel iteration algorithm with inertia weight is designed to solve the pricing problem. The numerical results have corroborated the effectiveness of the proposed method, illuminating the effects of bounded rationality and market regulation on the CNO’s profits and users’ travel costs.},

The list price should be posted in advance of the sale and is not negotiable with potential buyers. Any product not sold by the end of the sales period will be disposed at a lower price. Assuming that the customer's demand is represented as a negative binomial distribution, we determine the optimal product price based on the demand rate, buyers' preferences, and length of the sales period. Because the seller's average revenue decreases as the number of items for sale increases, we also consider the optimal-order quantity that maximizes the seller's total expected profit. For the case where the seller can divide the sales period into several short periods, we finally propose a multi-period pricing model.},

It is known that it can be adapted to continuous domains in some cases (in particular continuous action spaces). We here present an extension of Upper Confidence Trees to continuous stochastic problems. We (i) show a deceptive problem on which the classical Upper Confidence Tree approach does not work, even with arbitrarily large computational power and with progressive widening (ii) propose an improvement, termed double-progressive widening, which takes care of the compromise between variance (we want infinitely many simulations for each action/state) and bias (we want sufficiently many nodes to avoid a bias by the first nodes) and which extends the classical progressive widening (iii) discuss its consistency and show experimentally that it performs well on the deceptive problem and on experimental benchmarks. We guess that the double-progressive widening trick can be used for other algorithms as well, as a general tool for ensuring a good bias/variance compromise in search algorithms.},

We introduce two extensions of MCTS to deal with some of the challenges that Sokoban poses to MCTS methods, namely, the reduced search space that deadlock situations can cause and the large number of cycles. We also evaluate three domain-independent enhancements that have been shown to improve MCTS performance, namely, UCB1-Tuned, Rapid Action Value Estimation (RAVE), and Node Recycling. We perform a series of experiments to determine the best SP-MCTS configuration and then compare its performance to IDA*. We show that SP-MCTS can solve around 85\% of the levels with 1000000 iterations, that is the same performance reached by IDA* with only 10000 nodes. Overall, our results suggest that IDA* is still the best solver for Sokoban, also because it can easily integrate much domain knowledge. At the same time, our results also highlight some interesting directions to design better MCTS solvers for this domain.},

Cross, whose consulting company has invigorated some of the world's largest airlines; And hotel chains, draws on numerous case studies to present profit-making tactics that work in today's fast-moving marketplace. In describing how a one-chair barbershop, a regional opera company, and a medium-size airline all benefited enormously from the RM approach, he explains how no-tech, low-tech, and high-tech Revenue Management applications can revolutionize the way businesses make money. The RM-driven company has one overriding goal: to sell the right product to; The right customer at the right time for the right price. Cross clearly explains the concepts at the heart of Revenue Management, exploding a number of existing myths about contemporary business strategy; Includes index; Introduction: Cost-Cutting, Reengineering, Downsizing -- Now What? -- Ch. 1.

  abstract = {A major challenge for large-scale deployment of electrical vehicles (EVs) is charging. In general, the number of EVs that can be charged can be increased either by physically expanding charging capacity or by better exploiting existing charging capacity. In this paper, we focus on the latter, exploring how advanced EV travel planning systems can be used to better align where and when EV charging happens with where and when charging capacity is available. Our novel travel planner enables EV users to plan their trips and EV charging in a way that meets their needs yet reflects charging availability. The core innovation of our approach is that we take a broader, multidestination perspective to EV travel planning – this gives our planning system more flexibility and scope for deciding when and where charging should happen and, consequently, enables a better alignment between the need for charging implied by the EV travel and the availability of charging. We evaluate our approach on an agent-based simulation of several medium-scale scenarios based on real-world data. The results confirm the benefits of our multi-destination approach, especially in scenarios in which charging service providers support upfront booking of charging slots.},

In this paper, we introduce a new, genuinely multi-objective approach to EV travel planning, which can find Pareto sets containing multiple EV travel plans optimized simultaneously for multiple objectives.

To our knowledge, our algorithm is the first to perform such a genuine multi-objective optimization on realistically large country-scale problem instances involving 12,000 charging stations.

  abstract = {With the rapid development of electric vehicles (EVs) and charging infrastructures, the unbalanced utilization rate of fast charging stations (FCSTs) and the long waiting time for charging have aroused considerable attention. The incurred low operation profit of FCSTs and low satisfaction of EVs impose difficulties on the further development of EV industry. Existing literature ignored the influence of real-time charging price changes on traffic flow variation and EV charging determination during the dynamic price regulating process. This paper focuses on solving these crucial issues in the dynamic pricing for FCSTs with deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Firstly, considering the spatial–temporal interactions of different roads, a traffic flow prediction model is proposed based on the LSTM combined with the GNN-FiLM. Then, the Origin-Destination (OD) estimation is used to estimate the charging requirements of EVs based on the predicted traffic flow, and a charging demand prediction method for FCSTs is developed by converting the EV satisfaction into economic costs with different dimensions. Then, the vehicle–road learning environment is built with the Markov decision process (MDP), and a dynamic pricing strategy based on the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) learning is proposed to achieve the optimal charging prices of FCSTs with maximum operation profit. Moreover, during the learning process, the real-time charging price is renewed based on the predicted charging demand, and the future charging demand is further predicted under the renewed charging price until the optimal price is achieved. Finally, simulation results validate that the proposed dynamic pricing strategy effectively improves the profit of FCSTs, alleviates the road congestion, and improves the users’ satisfaction.},

  abstract = {ELECTRIFIC aims at seamlessly integrating e-mobility into the power grid while increasing EV attractiveness in order to make it possible to go for individual mobility, without a huge carbon footprint as long as the share of renewable energy in the battery is considerable. To do this, first of all the ecosystem of ELECTRIFIC was analysed, understood (baseline scenario) and extrapolated into a view consistent with the ELECTRIFIC objectives and its software solution (vision scenario). The results of this are presented in D2.2: Chapter II (The Electrific Ecosystem) analyses the ecosystem looking into the main issues that determine the usage of the ELECTRIFIC software solution. This means first of all the stakeholders, their business models and goals. Secondly, the ecosystem is analysed under a socio-economic view-point, which comprises contracts among the stakeholders, how they price the services that they trade amongst each other, and finally how the end-users of the ELECTRIFIC software solution, the so-called ADAS (Advanced Driver’s Assistant System), can be incentivized to follow the guidelines for optimized behaviour. The last broad issue which determines how ELECTRIFIC will operate in future and which infrastructure it can call upon today is the technical environment which is dealt with in Section II.3. Obviously this analysis needed to be instantiated onto the trial sites where the ELECTRIFIC approach will be tested – in Chapter III this is carried through for E-Wald (Germany), e-Sumava (Czech Republic), and the bus and scooter trials in Barcelona. Based on these findings, the requirements engineering process for ELECTRIFIC was completed by eliciting use-cases as well as business and technical requirements in Chapter IV. For a better understanding, the vision scenario that was the output of the analysis of the ELECTRIFIC ecosystem in Chapter II, was extracted and summarized at the beginning of Chapter IV.},

In particular, we will present a variety of incentives and choice architecture decisions that can play a large role in steering the EV users towards a behavior that might be less habitual than they are used to, but made more convenient and valuable by the suggestion. Two areas are targeted in WP6: the need to understand the user, their behaviours, attitudes and what makes EVs attractive or less attractive to them; and, fitting to this, ways in which these users can be motivated to adhere to smart solutions for example provided by the ELECTRIFIC application, a smart navigation tool that shows routing and charging choices along with provided availability and renewable energy information. This document presents analysis and outcomes of research into these two areas. After an introduction to the deliverable in Section I, we present the final development of usage and user profiles in Section II. Here, we briefly describe the survey that we developed and present an overview over data collected and results. Section III outlines the guidelines for development of the ELECTRIFIC application, as well as the final version of the app that has been developed based on these guidelines. We present concepts of ergonomic interaction and human-machine interface development, in particular the design of the graphical user interface (GUI) used in final trials. Section IV presents a summary of non-financial and financial behaviour steering techniques that have been employed in our research.

  abstract = {Uncontrolled and uncoordinated charging of Electric Vehicles (EVs) is producing various challenges in the distribution system, such as network congestion, overloading, and poor voltage profile, that would need grid reinforcement to accommodate EV charging load. However, smart charging of EVs can not only minimize or defer grid upgradation, which is a cost-intensive investment but also help EV stakeholders in optimizing their objectives such as loss minimization for distribution system operator, profit maximization for EV aggregator, charging cost minimization \& increased EV users satisfaction. This paper comprehensively reviews the smart charging strategies that address the challenges of uncontrolled EV charging while exploring the opportunities that smart charging can offer to stakeholders. In this paper, EV smart charging strategies are categorized based on different attributes including control topology, methodology, objectives, and electricity pricing. The control topology-based strategies viz., centralized, decentralized, distributed, hierarchical, and local strategies, are analyzed considering different stakeholder objectives, information \& decision signal flow, and transactive EV charging scenarios. In this paper, the benefits of electricity pricing-based strategies and transactive smart charging of EVs are investigated. This comprehensive review studies a wide spectrum of various EV smart charging strategies, challenges, opportunities, and future research directions.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a novel load management solution for coordinating the charging of multiple plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) in a smart grid system. Utilities are becoming concerned about the potential stresses, performance degradations and overloads that may occur in distribution systems with multiple domestic PEV charging activities. Uncontrolled and random PEV charging can cause increased power losses, overloads and voltage fluctuations, which are all detrimental to the reliability and security of newly developing smart grids. Therefore, a real-time smart load management (RT-SLM) control strategy is proposed and developed for the coordination of PEV charging based on real-time (e.g., every 5 min) minimization of total cost of generating the energy plus the associated grid energy losses. The approach reduces generation cost by incorporating time-varying market energy prices and PEV owner preferred charging time zones based on priority selection. The RT-SLM algorithm appropriately considers random plug-in of PEVs and utilizes the maximum sensitivities selection (MSS) optimization. This approach enables PEVs to begin charging as soon as possible considering priority-charging time zones while complying with network operation criteria (such as losses, generation limits, and voltage profile). Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the performance of SLM for the modified IEEE 23 kV distribution system connected to several low voltage residential networks populated with PEVs.},

  abstract = {The topic of dynamic pricing and learning has received a considerable amount of attention in recent years, from different scientific communities. We survey these literature streams: we provide a brief introduction to the historical origins of quantitative research on pricing and demand estimation, point to different subfields in the area of dynamic pricing, and provide an in-depth overview of the available literature on dynamic pricing and learning. Our focus is on the operations research and management science literature, but we also discuss relevant contributions from marketing, economics, econometrics, and computer science. We discuss relations with methodologically related research areas, and identify directions for future research.},

  abstract = {Electric Vehicle (EV) chargers operating in rapid and ultra-rapid modes have been increasingly implemented in recent years. However, their utilization trends have not been well assessed in Europe. Therefore, this article analyzes a dataset containing nearly 10,000 EV chargers and over 10 million EV charging events from the past four years. The dataset includes in-formation such as geographical location, connection and charging times, State-of-Charge (SoC) values, and energy delivered during each charging event. The analysis focuses on three representative European countries: Germany, France, and Norway, which collectively account for 60 \% of the total EV charging stations in Europe. The analysis of EV charging events reveals that over 99 \% of the connection periods last less than 2 hours, with an average connection time of 33 minutes. The estimation of EV battery capacities based on arrival and departure SoC values is also addressed. Additionally, this article proposes a methodology for classifying EV chargers into different clusters based on their nearest service utilization. The evaluated clusters include commercial, industrial, leisure, parking, residential, retail, and workplace. The analysis highlights that the retail cluster has the highest number of charging events. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the behavior and characteristics of EV charging stations in Europe. The findings can be used to optimize charging strategies and improve electrical grid reliability.},

  abstract = {Cloud computing providers must constantly hold many idle compute instances available (e.g., for maintenance or for users with long-term contracts). A natural idea, which should intuitively increase the provider’s profit, is to sell these idle instances on a secondary market, for example, via a preemptible spot market. However, this ignores possible “market cannibalization” effects that may occur in equilibrium as well as the additional costs the provider experiences due to preemptions. To study the viability of offering a spot market, we model the provider’s profit optimization problem by combining queuing theory and game theory to analyze the equilibria of the resulting queuing system. Our main result is an easy-to-check condition under which a provider can simultaneously achieve a profit increase and create a Pareto improvement for the users by offering a spot market (using idle resources) alongside a fixed-price market. Finally, we illustrate our results numerically to demonstrate the effects that the provider’s costs and her strategy have on her profit.

  abstract = {This paper examines the problem of proper (optimal) control over the seat allocation on flights. Given a heterogeneous fleet of aircraft types, multi-leg flights, a number of different passenger categories, and cancelations, an airline's objective is to devise an effective system which aids in setting the seat allocation targets for each category of passengers on each flight. This issue is analyzed by a number of authors in the context of economic, simulation based, probabilistic, and mathematical programming studies. We present an attempt to address this problem from the systems prospective emphasizing characteristics such as: passenger cancelations, multi-leg flights, and rolling tactical planning time horizon. Starting from a very simple network flow models for a single flight with a number of intermediate stops, a number of progressively complex models are presented. The airline flights and the seat allocation system are represented as a generalized network flow model (with gains/losses on arcs) with the objective of flow maximization (profit maximization). This modelling approach does not claim to replace the seat allocation approaches presented in Alstrup et al. (1985), Mayer (1976), Richter (1982), Simpson (1985a), and Wang (1983), but rather construct seat allocations utilizing some of those referenced schemes in a parameter setting mode for a large network model. The objective of this paper is not to report on computational experiments, but to present a modeling approach which seems to be promising, if somewhat speculative.},

  abstract = {Adopting extreme fast charging for electric vehicles will significantly reduce the charging time for electric vehicle owners, which will improve the public acceptance of electric vehicle. However, under the conditions of wide spread fast charging stations, large charging power of fast charging stations will bring nonnegligible impacts to the power system. For an aggregator that owns multiple fast charging stations, installing battery storage systems within the fast charging stations can reduce the impacts and give more flexibility. It will bring extra benefit if the aggregator participates in electricity markets by utilizing the flexibility of the storage. In order to deal with the operation and market participation problem for EV fast charging stations, this paper proposes bidding strategies in both energy and reserve markets for an aggregator of multiple fast charging stations with energy storage systems. Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) based mixed integer quadratic programming formulation is built to hedge the risks of random charging demands and volatile market prices. The proposed formulation is converted into a linear programming problem and an iterative solution method is designed to reduce the computation time. Case studies based on the trajectory data of taxis in Beijing have been carried out. Simulation results show that the aggregator can achieve higher economic benefits while satisfying the fast charging demand of electric vehicles.},

  abstract = {We investigate the degree to which modern web browsers are subject to “device fingerprinting” via the version and configuration information that they will transmit to websites upon request. We implemented one possible fingerprinting algorithm, and collected these fingerprints from a large sample of browsers that visited our test side, panopticlick.eff.org . We observe that the distribution of our fingerprint contains at least 18.1 bits of entropy, meaning that if we pick a browser at random, at best we expect that only one in 286,777 other browsers will share its fingerprint. Among browsers that support Flash or Java, the situation is worse, with the average browser carrying at least 18.8 bits of identifying information. 94.2\% of browsers with Flash or Java were unique in our sample. By observing returning visitors, we estimate how rapidly browser fingerprints might change over time. In our sample, fingerprints changed quite rapidly, but even a simple heuristic was usually able to guess when a fingerprint was an “upgraded” version of a previously observed browser’s fingerprint, with 99.1\% of guesses correct and a false positive rate of only 0.86\%. We discuss what privacy threat browser fingerprinting poses in practice, and what countermeasures may be appropriate to prevent it. There is a tradeoff between protection against fingerprintability and certain kinds of debuggability, which in current browsers is weighted heavily against privacy. Paradoxically, anti-fingerprinting privacy technologies can be self-defeating if they are not used by a sufficient number of people; we show that some privacy measures currently fall victim to this paradox, but others do not.},

Heuristic search as a problem solving tool is demonstrated in applications for puzzle solving, game playing, constraint satisfaction and machine learning. While no previous familiarity with heuristic search is necessary the reader should have a basic knowledge of algorithms, data structures, and calculus. Real-world case studies and chapter ending exercises help to create a full and realized picture of how search fits into the world of artificial intelligence and the one around us. The content is organized into five parts as follows: Search Primer: State-Space Search, Basic Search Algorithms, Dictionary Data Structures, and Automatically Created Heuristics Search under Memory Constraints: Linear-Space Search, Memory-Restricted Search, Symbolic Search, External Search Search Under Time Constraints: Distributed Search, State-Space Pruning, and Real-Time Search Search Variants: Adversary Search, Constraint Satisfaction Search, and Local Search Search Applications: Robotics, Automated System Verification, Action Planning, Vehicle Navigation, and Computational Biology.},

  abstract = {On-demand transport services in the form of dial-a-ride and taxis are crucial parts of the transport infrastructure in all major cities. However, not all on-demand transport services are equal: not-for-profit dial-a-ride services with coordinated drivers significantly differ from profit-motivated taxi services with uncoordinated drivers. In fact, there are two key threads of work on efficient scheduling, routing, and pricing for passengers: dial-a-ride services; and taxi services. Unfortunately, there has been only limited development of algorithms for joint optimization of scheduling, routing, and pricing; largely due to the widespread assumption of fixed pricing. In this paper, we introduce another thread: profit-motivated on-demand transport services with coordinated drivers. To maximize provider profits and the efficiency of the service, we propose a new market mechanism for this new thread of on-demand transport services, where passengers negotiate with the service provider. In contrast to previous work, our mechanism jointly optimizes scheduling, routing, and pricing. Ultimately, we demonstrate that our approach can lead to higher profits and reduced passenger prices, compared with standard fixed price approaches, while also improving efficiency.},

  abstract = {The benefits of dynamic pricing methods have long been known in industries, such as airlines, hotels, and electric utilities, where the capacity is fixed in the short-term and perishable. In recent years, there has been an increasing adoption of dynamic pricing policies in retail and other industries, where the sellers have the ability to store inventory. Three factors contributed to this phenomenon: (1) the increased availability of demand data, (2) the ease of changing prices due to new technologies, and (3) the availability of decision-support tools for analyzing demand data and for dynamic pricing. This paper constitutes a review of the literature and current practices in dynamic pricing. Given its applicability in most markets and its increasing adoption in practice, our focus is on dynamic (intertemporal) pricing in the presence of inventory considerations.},

  abstract = {The increasing penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) in the distribution grid has established them as a prospective resource for ancillary services. These services require adequate control strategies for prompt and efficient operation. In this study, an energy management scheme (EMS) has been proposed to employ an off-board EV smart charger to support the grid during short-term variance of renewables and reactive load onset. The scheme operates by calculating power references for the charger instantaneously. The EMS incorporates a proportional power division methodology, proposed to allocate power references to the individual EVs connected to the charger DC-bus. This methodology considers the state-of-charge and battery sizes of the EVs, and it can aggregate energy from various types of EVs. The proposed scheme is compared with another power allocation method, and the entire EMS is tested under the scenarios of power mismatch and voltage sag/swell events. The results show that the proposed scheme achieves the goal of the aggregation of EVs at the charger level to support the grid. The EMS also fulfills the objectives of voltage regulation and four-quadrant operation of the smart charger.},

  abstract = {Significant developments and advancement pertaining to electric vehicle (EV) technologies, such as extreme fast charging (XFC), have been witnessed in the last decade. However, there are still many challenges to the wider deployment of EVs. One of the major barriers is its availability of fast charging stations. A possible solution is to build a fast charging sharing system, by encouraging small business owners or even householders to install and share their fast charging devices, by reselling electricity energy sourced from traditional utility companies or their own solar grid. To incentivize such a system, a smart dynamic pricing scheme is needed to facilitate those growing markets with fast charging stations. The pricing scheme is expected to take into account the dynamics intertwined with pricing, demand, and environment factors, in an effort to maximize the long-term profit with the optimal price. To this end, this paper formulates the problem of dynamic pricing for fast charging as a Markov decision process and accordingly proposes several algorithmic schemes for different applications. Experimental study is conducted with useful and interesting insights.},

This paper leverages the strength of MuZero to enhance agents’ planning capability for joint active simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and navigation tasks, which require an agent to navigate an unknown environment while simultaneously constructing a map and localizing itself. We propose SLAMuZero, a novel approach for joint SLAM and navigation, which employs a search process that uses an explicit encoder-decoder architecture for mapping, followed by a prediction function to evaluate policy and value based on the generated map. SLAMuZero outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline and significantly reduces training time, underscoring the efficiency of our approach. Additionally, we develop a new open source library for implementing SLAMuZero, which is a flexible and modular toolkit for researchers and practitioners (https://github.com/bwfbowen/SLAMuZero).},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the simultaneous determination of pricing and inventory replenishment strategies in the face of demand uncertainty. More specifically, we analyze the following single item, periodic review model. Demands in consecutive periods are independent, but their distributions depend on the item's price in accordance with general stochastic demand functions. The price charged in any given period can be specified dynamically as a function of the state of the system. A replenishment order may be placed at the beginning of some or all of the periods. Stockouts are fully backlogged. We address both finite and infinite horizon models, with the objective of maximizing total expected discounted profit or its time average value, assuming that prices can either be adjusted arbitrarily (upward or downward) or that they can only be decreased. We characterize the structure of an optimal combined pricing and inventory strategy for all of the above types of models. We also develop an efficient value iteration method to compute these optimal strategies. Finally, we report on an extensive numerical study that characterizes various qualitative properties of the optimal strategies and corresponding optimal profit values.},

This reduction is based on the equivalence of a randomized policy that chooses actions only at jump epochs to a nonrandomized policy that can switch actions between jumps. For discounted CTMDPs with bounded jump rates, this reduction was introduced by the author in 2004 as a reduction to discounted MDPs. Here we show that this reduction also holds for unbounded jump and reward rates, but the corresponding MDP may not be discounted. However, the analysis of the equivalent total-reward MDP leads to the description of optimal policies for the CTMDP and provides methods for their computation.},

  abstract = {For solving problems from the domain of Mobility-on-Demand (MoD), we often need to connect vehicle plans into plans spanning longer time, a process we call plan chaining. As we show in this work, chaining of the plans can be used to reduce the size of MoD providers' fleet (fleet-sizing problem) but also to reduce the total driven distance by providing high-quality vehicle dispatching solutions in MoD systems. Recently, a solution that uses this principle has been proposed to solve the fleet-sizing problem. The method does not consider the time flexibility of the plans. Instead, plans are fixed in time and cannot be delayed. However, time flexibility is an essential property of all vehicle problems with time windows. This work presents a new plan chaining formulation that considers delays as allowed by the time windows and a solution method for solving it. Moreover, we prove that the proposed plan chaining method is optimal, and we analyze its complexity. Finally, we list some practical applications and perform a demonstration for one of them: a new heuristic vehicle dispatching method for solving the static dial-a-ride problem. The demonstration results show that our proposed method provides a better solution than the two heuristic baselines for the majority of instances that cannot be solved optimally. At the same time, our method does not have the largest computational time requirements compared to the baselines. Therefore, we conclude that the proposed optimal chaining method provides not only theoretically sound results but is also practically applicable.},

  abstract = {Growing concerns about environmental issues have led to the consideration of alternatives to current mobility. Electric mobility is one such alternative that is receiving a great deal of attention in Europe. In particular, a new legal framework for the introduction of an electric mobility system in Portugal has recently been set up by the government. A key issue in this system is recharging the batteries and, consequently, the location of charging stations. This paper presents a study on the location of electric-vehicle charging stations for an area of Lisbon, the capital city of Portugal, characterized with a strong concentration of population and employment. This type of area is appropriate for slow charging because vehicles stay parked for several hours within a 24-h period. The methodology used here is based on a maximal covering model to optimize the demand covered within an acceptable level of service and to define the number and capacity of the stations to be installed. The results clearly indicate that this methodology can be useful in the future planning of electric mobility systems.},

  abstract = {This article discusses a five-year, hourly economic model of vehicle-to-grid energy storage for peak reduction. Several scenarios are modeled for a participant using a 60 kW-h capacity battery electric vehicle, such as the Tesla Model S or Chevrolet Bolt, in the New York City area using pricing data for the years 2010 through 2014. Sensitivity analysis identifies that variables such as one-way power efficiency and battery lifetime are the major factors influencing the economics of selling electricity back to the grid. Although it is shown that vehicle-to-grid electricity sales can create positive economic benefits, the magnitudes are small due to the cost of added degradation to the vehicle's battery and are not likely to entice the average electric vehicle owner to participate. However, over the five-year period, the potential economic benefits of this technology have shown a promising trend. A carbon dioxide tax is examined as a potential policy measure to encourage vehicle-to-grid adoption. The implementation of a carbon dioxide tax is shown to create additional opportunities for economic gain but, these benefits are dependent on the grid's electricity generation portfolio. Added benefits from the tax are also small in magnitude considering current international carbon prices.},

Demand for each product is a stochastic point process with an intensity that is a function of the vector of prices for the products and the time at which these prices are offered. The problem is to price the finished products so as to maximize total expected revenue over the finite sales horizon. An upper bound on the optimal expected revenue is established by analyzing a deterministic version of the problem. The solution to the deterministic problem suggests two heuristics for the stochastic problem that are shown to be asymptotically optimal as the expected sales volume tends to infinity. Several applications of the model to network yield management are given. Numerical examples illustrate both the range of problems that can be modeled under this framework and the effectiveness of the proposed heuristics. The results provide several fundamental insights into the performance of yield management systems.},

In this paper, we propose a price-based iterative double auction for charger sharing markets where charger owners rent out their under-utilized chargers to the charge-needing EV drivers. Charger owners and EV drivers form a two-sided market which is cleared by a price-based double auction. Chargers’ locations, availabilities, and unit time service costs as well as drivers’ time and location preferences are considered in the allocation and scheduling process. The goal is to compute social welfare maximizing schedules which benefit both charger owners and EV drivers and, in turn, ensure the continuous growth of the market. We prove that the proposed double auction is budget balanced and individually rational. In addition, results from our computational study show that the proposed auction achieves on average 94\% efficiency compared with that of the optimal solutions and is suitable for a larger day-ahead charger sharing market setting in terms of running time.},

  abstract = {Many reinforcement learning (RL) tasks provide the agent with high-dimensional observations that can be simplified into low-dimensional continuous states. To formalize this process, we introduce the concept of a DeepMDP, a parameterized latent space model that is trained via the minimization of two tractable losses: prediction of rewards and prediction of the distribution over next latent states. We show that the optimization of these objectives guarantees (1) the quality of the latent space as a representation of the state space and (2) the quality of the DeepMDP as a model of the environment. We connect these results to prior work in the bisimulation literature, and explore the use of a variety of metrics. Our theoretical findings are substantiated by the experimental result that a trained DeepMDP recovers the latent structure underlying high-dimensional observations on a synthetic environment. Finally, we show that learning a DeepMDP as an auxiliary task in the Atari 2600 domain leads to large performance improvements over model-free RL.},

  abstract = {Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles are expected to place a considerable strain on local electricity distribution networks, requiring charging to be coordinated in order to accommodate capacity constraints. We design a novel online auction protocol for this problem, wherein vehicle owners use agents to bid for power and also state time windows in which a vehicle is available for charging. This is a multi-dimensional mechanism design domain, with owners having non-increasing marginal valuations for each subsequent unit of electricity. In our design, we couple a greedy allocation algorithm with the occasional "burning" of allocated power, leaving it unallocated, in order to adjust an allocation and achieve monotonicity and thus truthfulness. We consider two variations: burning at each time step or on-departure. Both mechanisms are evaluated in depth, using data from a real-world trial of electric vehicles in the UK to simulate system dynamics and valuations. The mechanisms provide higher allocative efficiency than a fixed price system, are almost competitive with a standard scheduling heuristic which assumes non-strategic agents, and can sustain a substantially larger number of vehicles at the same per-owner fuel cost saving than a simple random scheme.},

  abstract = {The paper considers a bidirectional power flow model of the electric vehicles (EVs) in a charging station. The EVs can inject energies by discharging via a Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) service which can enhance the profits of the charging station. However, frequent charging and discharging degrade battery life. A proper compensation needs to be paid to the users to participate in the V2G service. We propose a menu-based pricing scheme, where the charging station selects a price for each arriving user for the amount of battery utilization, the total energy, and the time (deadline) that the EV will stay. The user can accept one of the contracts or rejects all depending on their utilities. The charging station can serve users using a combination of the renewable energy and the conventional energy bought from the grid. We show that though there exists a profit maximizing price which maximizes the social welfare, it provides no surplus to the users if the charging station is aware of the utilities of the users. If the charging station is not aware of the exact utilities, the social welfare maximizing price may not maximize the expected profit. In fact, it can give a zero profit. We propose a pricing strategy which provides a guaranteed fixed profit to the charging station and it also maximizes the expected profit for a wide range of utility functions. Our analysis shows that when the harvested renewable energy is small the users have higher incentives for the V2G service. We, numerically, show that the charging station's profit and the user's surplus both increase as V2G service is efficiently utilized by the pricing mechanism.},

Furthermore, the speed of public charging is often expected to be similar to conventional refueling. For this reason, research on and political interest in public charging focus more and more on fast charging options with higher power rates, yet estimates for future needs are rare. This paper tries to fill this gap by analyzing current charging behavior from a large charging data set from Sweden and Norway and take the findings to calibrate a queuing model for future fast charging infrastructure needs. We find that the ratio of battery electric vehicles to public fast charging points can be similar to other alternative fuels in the future (close to one fast charging point per 1000 vehicles for high power rates of 150\,kW). In addition, the surplus on the electricity prices for payoff is only 0.05–0.15\,€/kWh per charging point. However, charging infrastructure needs highly depend on battery sizes and power rates that are both likely to increase in the future.},

Classical partial dependence plots (PDPs) help visualize the average partial relationship between the predicted response and one or more features. In the presence of substantial interaction effects, the partial response relationship can be heterogeneous. Thus, an average curve, such as the PDP, can obfuscate the complexity of the modeled relationship. Accordingly, ICE plots refine the partial dependence plot by graphing the functional relationship between the predicted response and the feature for individual observations. Specifically, ICE plots highlight the variation in the fitted values across the range of a covariate, suggesting where and to what extent heterogeneities might exist. In addition to providing a plotting suite for exploratory analysis, we include a visual test for additive structure in the data generating model. Through simulated examples and real data sets, we demonstrate how ICE plots can shed light on estimated models in ways PDPs cannot. Procedures outlined are available in the R package ICEbox.},

  abstract = {Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) are a natural and general model in reinforcement learning that take into account the agent's uncertainty about its current state. In the literature on POMDPs, it is customary to assume access to a planning oracle that computes an optimal policy when the parameters are known, even though the problem is known to be computationally hard. Almost all existing planning algorithms either run in exponential time, lack provable performance guarantees, or require placing strong assumptions on the transition dynamics under every possible policy. In this work, we revisit the planning problem and ask: are there natural and well-motivated assumptions that make planning easy? Our main result is a quasipolynomial-time algorithm for planning in (one-step) observable POMDPs. Specifically, we assume that well-separated distributions on states lead to well-separated distributions on observations, and thus the observations are at least somewhat informative in each step. Crucially, this assumption places no restrictions on the transition dynamics of the POMDP; nevertheless, it implies that near-optimal policies admit quasi-succinct descriptions, which is not true in general (under standard hardness assumptions). Our analysis is based on new quantitative bounds for filter stability -- i.e. the rate at which an optimal filter for the latent state forgets its initialization. Furthermore, we prove matching hardness for planning in observable POMDPs under the Exponential Time Hypothesis.},

Reflective of an individual's view of the world, a cognitive decision-making model is explored in a partially observable, stochastic environment. The cognitive model uses the Partially Observable Markov Decision Process problem formulation, which is a framework for neurological models and considered implementable in neural circuitry [26] [16]. To structure a planning model comparable to that of DeepMind's MuZero in a partially observable environment, a belief function will translate the observations to a vector of belief states that will be discretized so as to be used as the observations of a MuZero-based machine learning algorithm [29]. The belief states are computed recursively from the previous belief state using Bayesian inference. Bayes rule is thought to capture the neurological and cognitive levels of reasoning [26]. Components of the planning, training, and action methods of the cognitive model will follow those of MuZero. The model could then be trained and act, in way parallel to that of MuZero, in a partially observable environment. Cognitive insights from a model structured in this form and additional considerations are discussed.},

In recent years, these networks have become the state-of-the-art models for a variety of machine learning problems. This has led to a renewed interest in understanding the role and utility of various computational components of typical LSTM variants. In this paper, we present the first large-scale analysis of eight LSTM variants on three representative tasks: speech recognition, handwriting recognition, and polyphonic music modeling. The hyperparameters of all LSTM variants for each task were optimized separately using random search and their importance was assessed using the powerful fANOVA framework. In total, we summarize the results of 5400 experimental runs (about 15 years of CPU time), which makes our study the largest of its kind on LSTM networks. Our results show that none of the variants can improve upon the standard LSTM architecture significantly, and demonstrate the forget gate and the output activation function to be its most critical components. We further observe that the studied hyperparameters are virtually independent and derive guidelines for their efficient adjustment.},

  abstract = {Recently, households have begun to adopt networking technologies to interconnect devices within the home. Yet little is known about the consequences for households of setting up and living with these complex networks, nor the impact of such technologies on the routines of the home. In this paper, we report findings from an empirical study of households containing complex networks of computer and audio/visual technologies. Our study finds that home networks require significant household effort not just to coordinate their use, but also their set up and maintenance. We also show how the coordination around networking has to be worked into the routines of the home and the householders.},

  abstract = {We study the problem of non-parametric Bayesian estimation of the intensity function of a Poisson point process. The observations are \$n\$ independent realisations of a Poisson point process on the interval \$[0,T]\$. We propose two related approaches. In both approaches we model the intensity function as piecewise constant on \$N\$ bins forming a partition of the interval \$[0,T]\$. In the first approach the coefficients of the intensity function are assigned independent gamma priors, leading to a closed form posterior distribution. On the theoretical side, we prove that as \$n\textbackslash rightarrow\textbackslash infty,\$ the posterior asymptotically concentrates around the "true", data-generating intensity function at an optimal rate for \$h\$-H\textbackslash "older regular intensity functions (\$0 {$<$} h\textbackslash leq 1\$). In the second approach we employ a gamma Markov chain prior on the coefficients of the intensity function. The posterior distribution is no longer available in closed form, but inference can be performed using a straightforward version of the Gibbs sampler. Both approaches scale well with sample size, but the second is much less sensitive to the choice of \$N\$. Practical performance of our methods is first demonstrated via synthetic data examples. We compare our second method with other existing approaches on the UK coal mining disasters data. Furthermore, we apply it to the US mass shootings data and Donald Trump's Twitter data.},

The queuing model constructs a data set of plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) charging parameters which are input to the NN to determine the controllable EVCS load model. The queuing model considers arrival of PEVs as a non-homogeneous Poisson process, while the service time is modeled considering detailed characteristics of battery. The smart EVCS load is a function of number of PEVs charging simultaneously, total charging current, arrival rate, and time; and various class of PEVs. The EVCS load is integrated within a distribution operations framework to determine the optimal operation and smart charging schedules of the EVCS. Objective functions from the perspective of the local distribution company and EVCS owner are considered for studies. A 69-bus distribution system with an EVCS at a specific bus, and smart load model is considered for the studies. The performance of a smart EVCS vis-à-vis an uncontrolled EVCS is examined to emphasize the demand response contributions of a smart EVCS and its integration into distribution operations.},

  abstract = {Planning has been very successful for control tasks with known environment dynamics. To leverage planning in unknown environments, the agent needs to learn the dynamics from interactions with the world. However, learning dynamics models that are accurate enough for planning has been a long-standing challenge, especially in image-based domains. We propose the Deep Planning Network (PlaNet), a purely model-based agent that learns the environment dynamics from images and chooses actions through fast online planning in latent space. To achieve high performance, the dynamics model must accurately predict the rewards ahead for multiple time steps. We approach this using a latent dynamics model with both deterministic and stochastic transition components. Moreover, we propose a multi-step variational inference objective that we name latent overshooting. Using only pixel observations, our agent solves continuous control tasks with contact dynamics, partial observability, and sparse rewards, which exceed the difficulty of tasks that were previously solved by planning with learned models. PlaNet uses substantially fewer episodes and reaches final performance close to and sometimes higher than strong model-free algorithms.},

We present DreamerV3, a general algorithm that outperforms specialized methods across over 150 diverse tasks, with a single configuration. Dreamer learns a model of the environment and improves its behavior by imagining future scenarios. Robustness techniques based on normalization, balancing, and transformations enable stable learning across domains. Applied out of the box, Dreamer is the first algorithm to collect diamonds in Minecraft from scratch without human data or curricula. This achievement has been posed as a significant challenge in artificial intelligence that requires exploring farsighted strategies from pixels and sparse rewards in an open world. Our work allows solving challenging control problems without extensive experimentation, making reinforcement learning broadly applicable.},

One key feature of FCOU is that it employs an augmented Lagrangian function to create fuzzy clustering model for the construction of user profiles. Another key feature of FCOU is that it employs the combination of FCM, PHR and simulated annealing to develop ontology-based user profiles.

  abstract = {Emergency vehicles (EMVs) play an important role in saving human lives and mitigating property losses in urban traffic systems. Due to traffic congestion and improper priority control strategies along the rescue route, EMVs may not be able to arrive at rescue spots on time, which also increases traffic risk and has a negative impact on social vehicles (SVs). The greater the negative impact on SVs, such as increased delay times and queue length, the more profound the negative impacts on urban environmental sustainability. Proper rescue route selection and priority control strategies are essential for addressing this problem. Consequently, this paper systematically reviews the studies on EMV routing and priority control. First, a general bibliometric analysis is conducted using VOSviewer. This study also classifies the existing studies into three parts: EMV travel time prediction (EMV-TTP), EMV routing optimization (EMV-RO), and EMV traffic priority control (EMV-TPC). Finally, this study provides future research suggestions on five aspects: 1. uncovering authentic demand characteristics through EMV data mining, 2. incorporating the distinct characteristics of EMV in EMV-RO models, 3. implementing active EMV-TPC strategies, 4. concentrating more on the negative impacts on SVs, and 5. embracing the emerging technologies in the future urban traffic environment.},

  abstract = {Robots are expected to handle increasingly complex tasks. Such tasks often include interaction with objects or collaboration with other agents. One of the key challenges for reasoning in such situations is the lack of accurate models that hinders the effectiveness of planners. We present a system for online model adaptation that continuously validates and improves models while solving tasks with a belief space planner. We employ the well known online belief planner POMCP. Particles are used to represent hypotheses about the current state and about models of the world. They are sufficient to configure a simulator to provide transition and observation models. We propose an enhanced particle reinvigoration process that leverages prior experiences encoded in a recurrent neural network (RNN). The network is trained through interaction with a large variety of object and agent parametrizations. The RNN is combined with a mixture density network (MDN) to process the current history of observations in order to propose suitable particles and models parametrizations. The proposed method also ensures that newly generated particles are consistent with the current history. These enhancements to the particle reinvigoration process help alleviate problems arising from poor sampling quality in large state spaces and enable handling of dynamics with discontinuities. The proposed approach can be applied to a variety of domains depending on what uncertainty the decision maker needs to reason about. We evaluate the approach with experiments in several domains and compare against other state-of-the-art methods. Experiments are done in a collaborative multi-agent and a single agent object manipulation domain. The experiments are performed both in simulation and on a real robot. The framework handles reasoning with uncertain agent behaviors and with unknown object and environment parametrizations well. The results show good performance and indicate that the proposed approach can improve existing state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract = {The vehicle electrification will have a significant impact on the power grid due to the increase in electricity consumption. It is important to perform intelligent scheduling for charging and discharging of electric vehicles (EVs). However, there are two major challenges in the scheduling problem. First, it is challenging to find the globally optimal scheduling solution which can minimize the total cost. Second, it is difficult to find a distributed scheduling scheme which can handle a large population and the random arrivals of the EVs. In this paper, we propose a globally optimal scheduling scheme and a locally optimal scheduling scheme for EV charging and discharging. We first formulate a global scheduling optimization problem, in which the charging powers are optimized to minimize the total cost of all EVs which perform charging and discharging during the day. The globally optimal solution provides the globally minimal total cost. However, the globally optimal scheduling scheme is impractical since it requires the information on the future base loads and the arrival times and the charging periods of the EVs that will arrive in the future time of the day. To develop a practical scheduling scheme, we then formulate a local scheduling optimization problem, which aims to minimize the total cost of the EVs in the current ongoing EV set in the local group. The locally optimal scheduling scheme is not only scalable to a large EV population but also resilient to the dynamic EV arrivals. Through simulations, we demonstrate that the locally optimal scheduling scheme can achieve a close performance compared to the globally optimal scheduling scheme.},

Our evaluation setup complies with the limited knowledge of an attacker on a malicious web proxy server, who is only able to observe the host names visited by its users. The results suggest that consecutive sessions can be linked with high probability for session durations from 5 minutes to 48 hours and that user profiles degrade only slowly over time.

For evaluation we focus on the case of a curious DNS resolver. Therefore, we analyze the effectiveness of the techniques using a common, large-scale dataset that contains the DNS queries issued by more than 3600 users over the course of two months. We find that behavior-based tracking is feasible: The best technique can link up to 85.4\% of the surfing sessions of all users on a day-to-day basis. Moreover, for tracking to be effective only the most significant features or the most popular hostnames have to be considered. Our results indicate that users can degrade accuracy by changing their IP addresses more frequently, e.g., every few minutes. On the other hand, we find that the previously proposed DNS “range query” obfuscation techniques cannot prevent tracking reliably. Our findings are not limited to DNS traffic. Behavior-based tracking can be implemented by any adversary that has access to the web requests issued by users or their machines.},

  abstract = {Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) has drawn considerable interest in recent years, given its promise to improve sample efficiency. Moreover, when using deep-learned models, it is possible to learn compact and generalizable models from data. In this work, we study MuZero, a state-of-the-art deep model-based reinforcement learning algorithm that distinguishes itself from existing algorithms by learning a value-equivalent model. Despite MuZero's success and impact in the field of MBRL, existing literature has not thoroughly addressed why MuZero performs so well in practice. Specifically, there is a lack of in-depth investigation into the value-equivalent model learned by MuZero and its effectiveness in model-based credit assignment and policy improvement, which is vital for achieving sample efficiency in MBRL. To fill this gap, we explore two fundamental questions through our empirical analysis: 1) to what extent does MuZero achieve its learning objective of a value-equivalent model, and 2) how useful are these models for policy improvement? Our findings reveal that MuZero's model struggles to generalize when evaluating unseen policies, which limits its capacity for additional policy improvement. However, MuZero's incorporation of the policy prior in MCTS alleviates this problem, which biases the search towards actions where the model is more accurate.},

In this setting, users are allowed to explicitly express their preferences over different start times and the length of charging periods for charging their vehicles. The goal is to compute optimal charging schedules that maximize the social welfare of all users given their time preferences and the state of charge of their vehicles. Assuming that users are self-interested agents who may behave strategically to advance their own benefits rather than the social welfare of all agents, we propose an iterative auction, which computes high-quality schedules and, at the same time, preserves users' privacy by progressively eliciting their preferences as necessary. We conduct a game theoretical analysis on the proposed iterative auction to prove its individual rationality and the best response for agents. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the iterative auction can achieve high-efficiency solutions with a partial value information. Additionally, we explore the relationship between scheduling efficiency and information revelation in the auction.},

  abstract = {Highway charging scheduling for battery electric vehicles is a complex research issue depending on the fast charging capacity provided and the information available in coordinating drivers’ multiple charges at charging stations. Moreover, user’s partially-known preferences and potential dynamic events remain extra challenges in maximizing user’s satisfaction, improving the revenue of highway charging stations and utilizing the limited charging capacities. In such separate and simultaneous markets, users are reasonably modelled as the self-interested agents who aim to advance their own benefits but negotiable on their charging schedules. In this paper, we propose a simultaneous multi-round auction to address the highway charging scheduling problem, where users are allowed to bid and compromise on their preferred stops, charging time and energy simultaneously at separate charging stations. The objective is to maximize the total revenue of these stations. In the course of auction, users can gradually figure out how can their charges fit together by adaptively adjusting their bids placed at different stations. As a result, high-quality solutions are obtained and user’s privacy can be preserved by progressively eliciting their private preferences as necessary. In addition, we also develop a dynamic scheduling algorithm to address the changes of user’s reserved charges and unexpected arrivals of other vehicles. We conduct extensive experiments to validate our approach, the results demonstrate that it can achieve high efficiency with partial private information, as well as a higher revenue with dynamic scheduling algorithm. It can also greatly reduce the total waiting time of users against the first-come-first-serve policy.},

  abstract = {Effective decision-making in autonomous driving relies on accurate inference of other traffic agents' future behaviors. To achieve this, we propose an online belief-update-based behavior prediction model and an efficient planner for Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). We develop a Transformer-based prediction model, enhanced with a recurrent neural memory model, to dynamically update latent belief state and infer the intentions of other agents. The model can also integrate the ego vehicle's intentions to reflect closed-loop interactions among agents, and it learns from both offline data and online interactions. For planning, we employ a Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planner with macro actions, which reduces computational complexity by searching over temporally extended action steps. Inside the MCTS planner, we use predicted long-term multi-modal trajectories to approximate future updates, which eliminates iterative belief updating and improves the running efficiency. Our approach also incorporates deep Q-learning (DQN) as a search prior, which significantly improves the performance of the MCTS planner. Experimental results from simulated environments validate the effectiveness of our proposed method. The online belief update model can significantly enhance the accuracy and temporal consistency of predictions, leading to improved decision-making performance. Employing DQN as a search prior in the MCTS planner considerably boosts its performance and outperforms an imitation learning-based prior. Additionally, we show that the MCTS planning with macro actions substantially outperforms the vanilla method in terms of performance and efficiency.},

This sample-based policy iteration framework can in principle be applied to any reinforcement learning algorithm based upon policy iteration. Concretely, we propose Sampled MuZero, an extension of the MuZero algorithm that is able to learn in domains with arbitrarily complex action spaces by planning over sampled actions.

  abstract = {Electric vehicles (EVs) could effectively reduce the dependence of vehicle industry on fossil fuels; however, the complex charging behavior and large power consumption by EVs induce challenges to the operation of power grid. Accurate forecasting of power demand of EV charging station can provide important information for the operation planning of power grid. In this paper, a data-driven framework is proposed for short-term EV charging station demand forecasting. To fully mine the potential of machine learning algorithms in EV charging station demand forecasting, forecasting models based on different ma-chine learning algorithms have been developed including artificial neural network (ANN), support vector regression (SVR), and boosted regression trees (BRT). The performance of a machine learning algorithm highly depends on its hyperpa-rameters. To improve the forecasting performance, a hyperparameter opti-mization method is further developed based on Rao-l algorithm. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed data-driven framework for EV charging station demand forecasting, extensive computational experiments based on real data from different EV charging stations have been conducted. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed data-driven forecasting models perform much better than the widely considered persistence model while the ANN model and the BRT model outperforms the SVR model.},

  abstract = {The evolution of conventional electric grid into Smart Grid (SG) has enabled utilities as well as consumers to reap fruits due to its time varying price mechanisms. The utilities can acquire benefits by improving stability of grid, lessening blackouts and brownouts, knowing better their consumers power needs and not investing into new infrastructures. On the other hand consumer can also reduce electric bills, gain incentives by installing renewable energy sources and exporting energy to the main grid and attain improved services from utility. Demand Response (DR) is one of the most cost effective and reliable techniques used by utilities for consumers load shifting. In this paper, we are presenting a review of several DR techniques with a specific view on pricing signals, optimization, appliance scheduling used and their benefits. A comprehensive performance comparison is also prepared with the help of multiple criteria of SG paradigm.},

Online learning of optimal controllers for unknown POMDPs, which requires efficient learning using regret-minimizing algorithms that effectively tradeoff exploration and exploitation, is even harder, and no solution exists currently. In this paper, we consider infinite-horizon average-cost POMDPs with unknown transition model, though a known observation model. We propose a natural posterior sampling-based reinforcement learning algorithm (PSRL-POMDP) and show that it achieves a regret bound of O(logT)O(log⁡T)O(\textbackslash log T), where TTT is the time horizon, when the parameter set is finite. In the general case (continuous parameter set), we show that the algorithm achieves O(T2/3)O(T2/3)O(T\textasciicircum\{2/3\}) regret under two technical assumptions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first online RL algorithm for POMDPs and has sub-linear regret.},

Novel ICT-powered responsive mobility services, such as real-time on-demand transport, are interaction-rich in a sense that they rely on frequent, ad hoc interactions between various entities of the transport system. These interactions have to be properly captured in the model if it is to accurately represent the dynamics of the modelled transport system. Unfortunately, existing modelling tools are not well suited for modelling interaction-rich transport systems. We have therefore developed a novel modular simulation framework designed specifically for modelling transport systems in which ad hoc interactions and decision making play an important role. The framework provides an extensible library of modelling elements based on a unifying ontology of agent-based modelling abstractions, a high-performance discrete-event simulation engine and suite of tools supporting real-world deployment and utilization of implemented models. By fully leveraging the conceptual foundation of multiagent systems, our framework provides flexibility and extensibility that is difficult to achieve by existing approaches. We demonstrate the applicability of the framework on the models of five distinct interaction-rich transport systems.},

In this environment, the customers arrive over time and products are described by high-dimensional feature vectors. Each customer chooses a product according to the widely used Multinomial Logit (MNL) choice model and her utility depends on the product features as well as the prices offered. Our model allows for heterogenous price sensitivities for products. The seller a-priori does not know the parameters of the choice model but can learn them through interactions with the customers. The seller's goal is to design a pricing policy that maximizes her cumulative revenue. This model is motivated by online marketplaces such as Airbnb platform and online advertising. We measure the performance of a pricing policy in terms of regret, which is the expected revenue loss with respect to a clairvoyant policy that knows the parameters of the choice model in advance and always sets the revenue-maximizing prices. We propose a pricing policy, named M3P, that achieves a \$T\$-period regret of \$O(\textbackslash sqrt\{\textbackslash log(dT) T\})\$ under heterogenous price sensitivity for products with features dimension of \$d\$. We also prove that no policy can achieve worst-case \$T\$-regret better than \$\textbackslash Omega(\textbackslash sqrt\{T\})\$.},

  abstract = {Renewable energy and Electric Vehicles (EVs) are promising solutions for energy cost savings and emission reduction. However, integration of renewable energy sources into the electric grid could be a difficult task, because of the generation source intermittency and inconsistency with energy usage. In this paper, we present results of our study on the problem of allocating energy from renewable sources to EVs in a cost efficient manner. We have assumed that the renewable energy supply is time variant and in many ways unpredictable. EVs' charging requests should be satisfied within a specified time frame, which may incur a cost of drawing additional energy (possibly non-renewable energy) from the power grid if the renewable energy supply is not sufficient to meet the deadlines and may also reduce energy efficiency. We have formulated a stochastic optimization problem based on queuing model to minimize the time average cost of using non-renewable energy sources. The proposed approach fully considers the individual charging rate limit and deadline of each EV. The Lyapunov optimization technique is used to solve the problem. The developed dynamic control algorithm does not require knowledge of the statistical distribution of the time-varying renewable energy generation, EV charging demand, or extra energy pricing. Simulation results using different wind power generation profiles were performed and analyzed in the study. The results show that our EV charging scheduling method based on Lyapunov optimization can reduce both charging cost and mean delay time of fulfilling EV charging requests.},

  abstract = {As for any passenger transportation service provider, pricing and capacity management are two critical tools for the profitability of a passenger railroad service provider: pricing affects the demand for the services and the capacity management sets the availability of the services in advance. In this study, an expert system is developed as a decision support tool for a passenger railroad service provider’s integrated pricing and capacity management problem, which has great significance for the success of the service provider. Considering the demand uncertainty, we first formulate the integrated pricing and capacity management problem as a stochastic nonlinear integer programming (SNLIP) model. This model includes dynamic pricing and dynamic capacity allocation decisions for multiple service classes over a planning horizon in order to maximize profit. Also, several key characteristics of the passenger railroad service operations are captured in the model. Due to inherent demand uncertainty as well as the dynamic nature of the problem, a fast and efficient solution approach is needed. Therefore, a simulation-based procedure embedded in a simulated annealing method is proposed to solve the model. Several real-life cases from Fadak Five-Star Trains (an Iranian luxurious passenger railroad service provider) are presented to demonstrate the model and the solution approach. The results of the case studies show the operational and profitability impacts of using the proposed decision support tool as well as its potential capabilities for practical use by other service providers.},

  abstract = {Particle filtering is a powerful approach to sequential state estimation and finds application in many domains, including robot localization, object tracking, etc. To apply particle filtering in practice, a critical challenge is to construct probabilistic system models, especially for systems with complex dynamics or rich sensory inputs such as camera images. This paper introduces the Particle Filter Network (PFnet), which encodes both a system model and a particle filter algorithm in a single neural network. The PF-net is fully differentiable and trained end-to-end from data. Instead of learning a generic system model, it learns a model optimized for the particle filter algorithm. We apply the PF-net to a visual localization task, in which a robot must localize in a rich 3-D world, using only a schematic 2-D floor map. In simulation experiments, PF-net consistently outperforms alternative learning architectures, as well as a traditional model-based method, under a variety of sensor inputs. Further, PF-net generalizes well to new, unseen environments.},

  abstract = {Cloud service providers can provide increasingly powerful upgrades of their virtual machines to their customers, but at a launching cost, and at the expense of the sales of existing products. We propose a model of product introduction and characterize the optimal pricing and timing of introductions of new virtual machines for a cloud service provider in the face of customers who are averse to upgrading to improved offerings. Overall, we show that a simple policy of Myerson (i.e., myopic) pricing and periodic introductions is near-optimal. We first show that under a Myerson pricing rule, there is no loss of optimality with a periodic schedule of introductions, and that under periodic introductions, the potential additional revenue of any pricing policy over Myerson pricing decays to zero after sufficiently many introductions. We then show that, given arbitrary fixed introduction times, Myerson pricing is approximately optimal. To do so, we characterize the prices that achieve optimal revenue in a single introduction period and provide a bound for the competitive ratio of Myerson pricing over the optimal single-period pricing. This bound shows that Myerson pricing is approximately optimal when switching costs for the customers who upgrade are small or large. Following our analysis, we examine our analytical bounds for Myerson pricing with simulations and show that they can provide strong guarantees for all values of the switching cost, for several natural distributions for the customer type. Furthermore, when we numerically compute optimal prices, rather than using our bounds, we find that Myerson pricing is often several orders of magnitude closer to optimal than our analytical bounds suggest.},

The few Bayesian RL methods that are applicable in partially observable domains, such as the Bayes-Adaptive POMDP (BA-POMDP), scale poorly. To address this issue, we introduce the Factored BA-POMDP model (FBA-POMDP), a framework that is able to learn a compact model of the dynamics by exploiting the underlying structure of a POMDP. The FBA-POMDP framework casts the problem as a planning task, for which we adapt the Monte-Carlo Tree Search planning algorithm and develop a belief tracking method to approximate the joint posterior over the state and model variables. Our empirical results show that this method outperforms a number of BRL baselines and is able to learn efficiently when the factorization is known, as well as learn both the factorization and the model parameters simultaneously.},

Bayes-Adaptive Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (BA-POMDPs) extend POMDPs to allow the model to be learned during execution. BA-POMDPs are a Bayesian RL approach that, in principle, allows for an optimal trade-off between exploitation and exploration. Unfortunately, BA-POMDPs are currently impractical to solve for any non-trivial domain. In this paper, we extend the Monte-Carlo Tree Search method POMCP to BA-POMDPs and show that the resulting method, which we call BA-POMCP, is able to tackle problems that previous solution methods have been unable to solve. Additionally, we introduce several techniques that exploit the BA-POMDP structure to improve the efficiency of BA-POMCP along with proof of their convergence.},

  abstract = {Much of the network revenue management (NRM) literature considers capacity control problems where product prices are fixed and the product availability is controlled over time. However, for industries with imperfect competition, firms typically retain some pricing power and dynamic pricing models are more realistic than capacity control models. Dynamic pricing problems are more challenging to solve; even the deterministic version is typically nonlinear. In this study, we consider a dynamic programming model and use approximate linear programs (ALPs) to solve the problem. Unlike capacity control problems, the ALPs are semi-infinite linear programs, for which we propose a column generation algorithm. Furthermore, for the affine approximation under a linear independent demand model, we show that the ALPs can be reformulated as compact second order cone programs (SOCPs). The size of the SOCP formulation is linear in model primitives, including the number of resources, the number of products, and the number of periods. In addition, we consider a version of the model with discrete price sets and show that the resulting ALPs admit compact reformulations. We report numerical results on computational and policy performance on a set of hub-and-spoke problem instances.},

If unfolded into equivalent trees, Monte-Carlo Tree Search algorithms are a valid alternative. UCT, the most popular representative, obtains good anytime behavior by guiding the search towards promising areas of the search tree. The Heuristic Search algorithm AO∗ finds optimal solutions for MDPs that can be represented as acyclic AND/OR graphs. We introduce a common framework, Trial-based Heuristic Tree Search, that subsumes these approaches and distinguishes them based on five ingredients: heuristic function, backup function, action selection, outcome selection, and trial length. Using this framework, we describe three new algorithms which mix these ingredients in novel ways in an attempt to combine their different strengths. Our evaluation shows that two of our algorithms not only provide superior theoretical properties to UCT, but also outperform state-of-the-art approaches experimentally.},

  abstract = {We consider the problem of scheduling complex-valued demands over a discretized time horizon. Given a set of users, each user is associated with a set of demands representing different user’s preferences. A demand is represented by a complex number, a time interval, and a utility value obtained if the demand is satisfied. At each time slot, the magnitude of the total selected demands should not exceed a given capacity. This naturally captures the supply constraints in alternating current (AC) electric systems. In this paper, we consider maximizing the aggregate user utility subject to power supply limits over a time horizon. We present approximation algorithms characterized by the maximum angle ϕϕ\textbackslash phi between any two complex-valued demands. More precisely, a PTAS is presented for the case ϕ∈[0,π2]ϕ∈[0,π2]\textbackslash phi \textbackslash in [0,\textbackslash tfrac\{\textbackslash pi \}\{2\}], a bi-criteria FPTAS for ϕ∈[0,π- δ]ϕ∈[0,π- δ]\textbackslash phi \textbackslash in [0,\{\textbackslash pi \} \textbackslash text\{- \} \textbackslash delta ] for any polynomially small δδ\textbackslash delta , assuming the number of time slots in the discretized time horizon is a constant. Furthermore, if the number of time slots is polynomial, we present a reduction to the real-valued unsplittable flow on a path problem with only a constant approximation ratio. Finally, we present a practical greedy algorithm for the single time slot case with an approximation ratio of 12cosϕ212cos⁡ϕ2\textbackslash tfrac\{1\}\{2\}\textbackslash cos \textbackslash frac\{\textbackslash phi \}\{2\}, while the running time is O(nlogn)O(nlog⁡n)\{O\}(n\textbackslash log n), which can be implemented efficiently in practice.},

However, previous studies in the fields of the management of PHEV charging stations have not synthetically taken practical charging systems into account. In this paper, we study the profit-optimal management of a PHEV charging station under the realistic environment addressing not only various types of vehicles but waiting time guarantee for PHEV customers as well. This paper is first to jointly take into account pricing for charging services, scheduling of reserved vehicles to PHEV chargers, dropping of reserved vehicles, and management of the energy storage in a unified framework that contains key features of a practical PHEV charging station. Based on this framework, we develop an algorithm to find the parameters required for charging management by invoking the “Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty” technique. Through theoretical analysis, we prove that the proposed algorithm achieves close-to-optimal performance under particular conditions by exploiting opportunism of time-varying arrival of charging vehicles, price of electricity, and renewable energy generation, but it requires no probabilistic future information. Finally, we find several significant messages via trace-driven simulation of the proposed algorithm.},

The other, the Poisson process, seems at first sight humbler and less worthy of study in its own right. Nearly every book mentions it, but most hurry past to more general point processes or Markov chains. This comparative neglect is ill judged, and stems from a lack of perception of the real importance of the Poisson process. This distortion partly comes about from a restriction to one dimension, while the theory becomes more natural in more general context. This book attempts to redress the balance. It records Kingman's fascination with the beauty and wide applicability of Poisson processes in one or more dimensions.

This comparative neglect is ill judged, and stems from a lack of perception of the real importance of the Poisson process. This distortion partly comes about from a restriction to one dimension, while the theory becomes more natural in more general contexts. This book attempts to redress the balance. It records the author's fascination with the beauty and wide applicability of Poisson processes in one or more dimensions. The mathematical theory is powerful and a few key results often produce surprising consequences.},

This article is the second and final part of a paper series surveying the scientific developments and achievements in revenue management over the past 15 years. The first part focused on the general methodological advances regarding choice-based theory and methods of availability control over time. In this second part, we discuss some of the most important generalizations of the standard revenue management setting: product innovations (opaque products and flexible products), upgrading, overbooking, personalization, and risk-aversion. Furthermore, to demonstrate the broad use of revenue management, we survey important industry applications beyond passenger air transportation that have received scientific attention over the years, covering air cargo, hotel, car rental, attended home delivery, and manufacturing. We work out the specific revenue management-related challenges of each industry and portray the key contributions from the literature. We conclude the paper with some directions for future research.},

  abstract = {Research of airlines shows that seat inventory control and therefore, revenue management is based not on a systematic analysis but more on human judgement. Machine learning models have been developed and applied to support decisions for ticket pricing dynamically. However, conventional models and approaches yield low statistical evaluation scores. In this study, the features used in other studies were explored and the cost available seat kilometer (CASK) value and target revenue features were included for the first time to the best of our knowledge which are essential components of ticket price decision. Real data from a low-cost carrier airline in Turkey were collected and the observation data were splitted into two to study with the highest profit sale data. Then the outliers were filtered to let the models learn from and generate better price offerings businesswise. Observation datasets obtained in each step were recorded to be tested. 7 different model techniques were simulated and tested with 4 different datasets according to 6 different statistical evaluation criteria. A new approach to Interpretable Multi-Variable Long Short-Term Memory (IMV-LSTM) model was proposed by taking every flight and its sales as an independent series, that is to assign a dynamic batch size. Extensive experiments on real datasets reveal enhanced statistical evaluation scores by using the proposed approach and model. The proposed model can be used by the airlines to mitigate human judgement on ticket pricing, to manage their price offerings to reach their target revenues and to increase their profits. The model can be used by other business cases that have similar historical data as overlapping windows structure.},

The definition works for an arbitrary (perfect recall) extensive-form game and is not tied to any specific game-solving algorithm. Moreover, this framework unifies and significantly extends three approaches to depth-limited solving that previously existed in extensive-form games and multiagent reinforcement learning but were not known to be compatible. A key ingredient of these depth-limited games is value functions. Focusing on two-player zero-sum imperfect-information games, we show how to obtain optimal value functions and prove that public information provides both necessary and sufficient context for computing them. We provide a domain-independent encoding of the domains that allows for approximating value functions even by simple feed-forward neural networks, which are then able to generalize to unseen parts of the game. We use the resulting value network to implement a depth-limited version of counterfactual regret minimization. In three distinct domains, we show that the algorithm's exploitability is roughly linearly dependent on the value network's quality and that it is not difficult to train a value network with which depth-limited CFR's performance is as good as that of CFR with access to the full game.},

The difference arises in the intermittent nature of mass transit capacity provision. It is shown that (1) increased ridership leads to higher average user cost, and (2) the relationship between service frequency and ridership does not conform to the well-known square root principle.},

  abstract = {Towards achieving the goal of green transportation, the usage of battery powered electric vehicles (BEVs) has been continuously growing across the globe. However, considering the limited number of Charging Stations (CSs) in the cities, electric vehicle charging problem has become a challenging task, especially, due to the constraints of longer waiting time and dynamic pricing at the CHs. This issue has led to the degradation in Quality of Experience (QoE) for BEV drivers. Moreover, Charging Point (CP) service providers in the cities also suffer from lack of space which causes higher congestion at the CSs. In this context, we propose ChaseMe, a heuristic scheme for optimizing CS management by scheduling BEVs based on availability and type (fast/ultra-fast) of CPs by considering delay and charging time for CPs reservation. The proposed heuristic scheme consists of two soft computing techniques i) Harris Hawk Optimization (HHO) and ii) Fuzzy Inference System (FIS). Former technique is used to map the CP reservation requests to the best-suited CS by considering Quality of Service (QoS) parameters and acting as a global optimizer. FIS locally manages CPs at a particular CS in coordination with proposed meta-heuristic technique. The experimental results prove the benefits of the proposed ChaseMe framework as compared to the state-of-the-art techniques considering various charging metrics for BEVs.},

  abstract = {Off-policy reinforcement learning aims to leverage experience collected from prior policies for sample-efficient learning. However, in practice, commonly used off-policy approximate dynamic programming methods based on Q-learning and actor-critic methods are highly sensitive to the data distribution, and can make only limited progress without collecting additional on-policy data. As a step towards more robust off-policy algorithms, we study the setting where the off-policy experience is fixed and there is no further interaction with the environment. We identify bootstrapping error as a key source of instability in current methods. Bootstrapping error is due to bootstrapping from actions that lie outside of the training data distribution, and it accumulates via the Bellman backup operator. We theoretically analyze bootstrapping error, and demonstrate how carefully constraining action selection in the backup can mitigate it. Based on our analysis, we propose a practical algorithm, bootstrapping error accumulation reduction (BEAR). We demonstrate that BEAR is able to learn robustly from different off-policy distributions, including random and suboptimal demonstrations, on a range of continuous control tasks.},

  abstract = {To enhance environmental sustainability, many countries will electrify their transportation systems in their future smart city plans, so the number of electric vehicles (EVs) running in a city will grow significantly. There are many ways to recharge EVs' batteries and charging stations will be considered as the main source of energy. The locations of charging stations are critical; they should not only be pervasive enough such that an EV anywhere can easily access a charging station within its driving range, but also widely spread so that EVs can cruise around the whole city upon being recharged. Based on these new perspectives, we formulate the EV charging station placement problem (EVCSPP) in this paper. We prove that the problem is nondeterministic polynomial-time hard. We also propose four solution methods to tackle EVCSPP, and evaluate their performance on various artificial and practical cases. As verified by the simulation results, the methods have their own characteristics and they are suitable for different situations depending on the requirements for solution quality, algorithmic efficiency, problem size, nature of the algorithm, and existence of system prerequisite.},

Observations are gathered by an agent traversing the graph. Aliasing means that multiple nodes emit the same observation, so the agent can not know in which node it is located. The agent needs to uncover the hidden topology as accurately as possible and in as few steps as possible. This is equivalent to efficient recovery of the transition probabilities of a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) in which the observation probabilities are known. An algorithm for efficiently exploring (and ultimately recovering) the latent graph is provided. Our approach is exponentially faster than naive exploration in a variety of challenging topologies with aliased observations while remaining competitive with existing baselines in the unaliased regime.},

  abstract = {Profit maximization of electric vehicle charging station (EVCS) operation yields an increasing investment for the deployment of EVCSs, thereby increasing the penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) and supporting high-quality charging service to EV users. However, existing model-based approaches for profit maximization of EVCSs may exhibit poor performance owing to the underutilization of massive data and inaccurate modeling of EVCS operation in a dynamic environment. Furthermore, the existing approaches can be vulnerable to adversaries that abuse private EVCS operation data for malicious purposes. To resolve these limitations, we propose a privacy-preserving distributed deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that maximizes the profits of multiple smart EVCSs integrated with photovoltaic and energy storage systems under a dynamic pricing strategy. In the proposed framework, DRL agents using the soft actor–critic method determine the schedules of the profitable selling price and charging/discharging energy for EVCSs. To preserve the privacy of EVCS operation data, a federated reinforcement learning method is adopted in which only the local and global neural network models of the DRL agents are exchanged between the DRL agents at the EVCSs and the global agent at the central server without sharing EVCS data. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of convergence of the training curve for the DRL agent, adaptive profitable selling price, energy charging and discharging, sensitivity of the selling price factor, and varying weather conditions.},

However, many real-world problems involve continuous action spaces, where MCTS is not as effective as in discrete action spaces. This is mainly due to common practices such as coarse discretization of the entire action space and failure to exploit local smoothness. In this paper, we introduce Value-Gradient UCT (VG-UCT), which combines traditional MCTS with gradient-based optimization of action particles. VG-UCT simultaneously performs a global search via UCT with respect to the finitely sampled set of actions and performs a local improvement via action value gradients. In the experiments, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing MCTS methods and other strong baseline algorithms for continuous action spaces.},

In this work, we seek to understand the belief-space properties that allow some POMDP problems to be approximated efficiently and thus help to explain the point-based algorithms’ success often ob- served in the experiments. We show that an approximately optimal POMDP so- lution can be computed in time polynomial in the covering number of a reachable belief space, which is the subset of the belief space reachable from a given belief point. We also show that under the weaker condition of having a small covering number for an optimal reachable space, which is the subset of the belief space reachable under an optimal policy, computing an approximately optimal solution is NP-hard. However, given a suitable set of points that “cover” an optimal reach- able space well, an approximate solution can be computed in polynomial time. The covering number highlights several interesting properties that reduce the com- plexity of POMDP planning in practice, e.g., fully observed state variables, beliefs with sparse support, smooth beliefs, and circulant state-transition matrices.},

  abstract = {We present a branch-and-bound (B\&B) framework for the asymmetric prize-collecting Steiner tree problem (APCSTP). Several well-known network design problems can be transformed to the APCSTP, including the Steiner tree problem (STP), prize-collecting Steiner tree problem (PCSTP), maximum-weight connected subgraph problem (MWCS), and node-weighted Steiner tree problem (NWSTP). The main component of our framework is a new dual ascent algorithm for the rooted APCSTP, which generalizes Wong’s dual ascent algorithm for the Steiner arborescence problem. The lower bounds and dual information obtained from the algorithm are exploited within powerful bound-based reduction tests and for guiding primal heuristics. The framework is complemented by additional alternative-based reduction tests. Extensive computational results on benchmark instances for the PCSTP, MWCS, and NWSTP indicate the framework’s effectiveness, as most instances from literature are solved to optimality within seconds, including most of the (previously unsolved) largest instances from the recent DIMACS Challenge on Steiner trees. Moreover, results on new asymmetric instances for the APCSTP are reported. Since the addressed network design problems are frequently used for modeling various real-world applications (e.g., in bioinformatics), the implementation of the presented B\&B framework has been made publicly available. The online supplement is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/ijoc.2017.0788.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an integrated distribution locational marginal pricing (DLMP) method designed to alleviate congestion induced by electric vehicle (EV) loads in future power systems. In the proposed approach, the distribution system operator (DSO) determines distribution locational marginal prices (DLMPs) by solving the social welfare optimization of the electric distribution system which considers EV aggregators as price takers in the local DSO market and demand price elasticity. Nonlinear optimization has been used to solve the social welfare optimization problem in order to obtain the DLMPs. The efficacy of the proposed approach was demonstrated by using the bus 4 distribution system of the Roy Billinton Test System (RBTS) and Danish driving data. The case study results show that the integrated DLMP methodology can successfully alleviate the congestion caused by EV loads. It is also shown that the socially optimal charging schedule can be implemented through a decentralized mechanism where loads respond autonomously to the posted DLMPs by maximizing their individual net surplus.},

  abstract = {This paper considers dynamic booking control for a single-station car rental revenue management problem. Different from conventional airline revenue management, car rental revenue management needs to take into account not only the existing bookings but also the lengths of the existing rentals and the capacity flexibility via fleet shuttling, which yields a high-dimensional system state space. In this paper, we formulate the dynamic booking control problem as a discrete-time stochastic dynamic program over an infinite horizon. Such a model is computationally intractable. We propose a decomposition approach and develop two heuristics. The first heuristic is an approximate dynamic program (ADP) which approximates the value function using the value functions of the decomposed problems. The second heuristic is constructed directly from the optimal booking limits computed from the decomposed problems, which is more scalable compared to the ADP heuristic. Our numerical study suggests that the performances of both heuristics are close to optimum and significantly outperform the commonly used probabilistic non-linear programming (PNLP) heuristic in most of the instances. The dominant performance of our second heuristic is evidenced in a case study using sample data from a major car rental company in the UK.},

  abstract = {Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) provide a flexible representation for real-world decision and control problems. However, POMDPs are notoriously difficult to solve, especially when the state and observation spaces are continuous or hybrid, which is often the case for physical systems. While recent online sampling-based POMDP algorithms that plan with observation likelihood weighting have shown practical effectiveness, a general theory characterizing the approximation error of the particle filtering techniques that these algorithms use has not previously been proposed. Our main contribution is bounding the error between any POMDP and its corresponding finite sample particle belief MDP (PB-MDP) approximation. This fundamental bridge between PB-MDPs and POMDPs allows us to adapt any sampling-based MDP algorithm to a POMDP by solving the corresponding particle belief MDP, thereby extending the convergence guarantees of the MDP algorithm to the POMDP. Practically, this is implemented by using the particle filter belief transition model as the generative model for the MDP solver. While this requires access to the observation density model from the POMDP, it only increases the transition sampling complexity of the MDP solver by a factor of O(C), where C is the number of particles. Thus, when combined with sparse sampling MDP algorithms, this approach can yield algorithms for POMDPs that have no direct theoretical dependence on the size of the state and observation spaces. In addition to our theoretical contribution, we perform five numerical experiments on benchmark POMDPs to demonstrate that a simple MDP algorithm adapted using PB-MDP approximation, Sparse-PFT, achieves performance competitive with other leading continuous observation POMDP solvers.},

The objective is to minimize the total charging cost with user dissatisfaction taken into account. We focus on the online setting where neither accurate prediction nor distribution of future real-time prices is available to the user when making irrevocable charging decisions in each time slot. The emphasis on considering user dissatisfaction and achieving optimal competitive ratio differentiates our work from existing ones and makes our study uniquely challenging. Our key contribution is two simple online algorithms with the optimal competitive ratio among all deterministic algorithms. The optimal competitive ratio is upper-bounded by \textbackslash min łeft \{ \textbackslash sqrt \textbackslash alpha /p\_\textbackslash min ,p\_\textbackslash max /p\_\textbackslash min \textbackslash right \} and the bound is asymptotically tight with respect to \textbackslash alpha , where p\textsubscript{\textbackslash max } and p\textsubscript{\textbackslash min } are the upper and lower bounds of real-time prices and \textbackslash alpha \textbackslash geq p\textsubscript{\textbackslash min } captures the consideration of user dissatisfaction. The bounds with respect to small and large values of \textbackslash alpha suggest the fundamental difference of the problems with and without considering user dissatisfaction. We also extend the algorithms to take minimum charging requirement and short-term prediction into account. Simulation results based on real-world traces corroborate our theoretical findings and show that the empirical performance of our algorithms can be substantially better than the theoretical worst-case guarantees. Our algorithms also achieve notable performance gains under diverse settings as compared to conceivable alternatives.},

CORC Technical Report TR-2004-01, Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research, Columbia University, New York.] recently proposed a choice-based deterministic linear programming model (CDLP) for network revenue management (RM) that parallels the widely used deterministic linear programming (DLP) model. While they focused on analyzing “flexible products”—a situation in which the provider has the flexibility of using a collection of products (e.g., different flight times and/or itineraries) to serve the same market demand (e.g., an origin-destination connection)—their approach has broader implications for understanding choice-based RM on a network. In this paper, we explore the implications in detail. Specifically, we characterize optimal offer sets (sets of available network products) by extending to the network case a notion of “efficiency” developed by Talluri and van Ryzin [Talluri, K. T., G. J. van Ryzin. 2004. Revenue management under a general discrete choice model of consumer behavior. Management Sci.50 15–33.] for the single-leg, choice-based RM problem. We show that, asymptotically, as demand and capacity are scaled up, only these efficient sets are used in an optimal policy. This analysis suggests that efficiency is a potentially useful approach for identifying “good” offer sets on networks, as it is in the case of single-leg problems. Second, we propose a practical decomposition heuristic for converting the static CDLP solution into a dynamic control policy. The heuristic is quite similar to the familiar displacement-adjusted virtual nesting (DAVN) approximation used in traditional network RM, and it significantly improves on the performance of the static LP solution. We illustrate the heuristic on several numerical examples.},

  abstract = {The goal of meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) is to build agents that can quickly learn new tasks by leveraging prior experience on related tasks. Learning a new task often requires both exploring to gather task-relevant information and exploiting this information to solve the task. In principle, optimal exploration and exploitation can be learned end-to-end by simply maximizing task performance. However, such meta-RL approaches struggle with local optima due to a chicken-and-egg problem: learning to explore requires good exploitation to gauge the exploration’s utility, but learning to exploit requires information gathered via exploration. Optimizing separate objectives for exploration and exploitation can avoid this problem, but prior meta-RL exploration objectives yield suboptimal policies that gather information irrelevant to the task. We alleviate both concerns by constructing an exploitation objective that automatically identifies task-relevant information and an exploration objective to recover only this information. This avoids local optima in end-to-end training, without sacrificing optimal exploration. Empirically, DREAM substantially outperforms existing approaches on complex meta-RL problems, such as sparse-reward 3D visual navigation. Videos of DREAM: https://ezliu.github.io/dream/},

To achieve complexity reduction, the structure of the optimal policy can be exploited and incorporated into standard algorithms. In addition, function approximation can also be applied, where the value function is approximated by the linear combination of some basis vectors in a lower dimensional subspace. The main challenge for function approximation lies in the absence of general guidelines for subspace construction. In this paper, a proper subspace for projection is first generated based on system information, and more general construction methods are proposed using tools from graph signal processing (GSP). Graph symmetrization methods are also used to tackle the directed nature of the probability transition graph so that the well-developed GSP theory for undirected graphs can be employed. The numerical results for a typical wireless system show that standard algorithms with structural information incorporated can achieve 50\% complexity reduction without performance loss. The subspace generated from the system can achieve zero policy error with faster runtime, and the GSP approach can also provide a proper subspace for perfect reconstruction of the optimal policy. It is also shown that how the proposed method can be applied to other MDP problems.},

Three approaches were studied: dumb charging, dual tariff policy and smart charging. To assess the efficacy of such procedures, the grid integration of EVs was pushed to its limit for each of the adopted charging management approaches. A Medium Voltage (MV) grid, representative of a residential area distribution grid in Portugal, was used as testing environment. Several shares of EVs technologies were considered for different integration scenarios. Voltage profiles and branch congestion levels were evaluated, for the peak load hour, for grid technical limits checking. Losses were also evaluated for a typical daily load profile.},

In this context, the robustness of network infrastructures, e.g. air transport networks, are a central issue in transport geography. Disruption of communication links by intentional causes (e.g., terrorist attack on an airport) or unintentional (e.g., weather inclemency) could be crucial for countries, regions and even the airlines affected themselves. Policymakers and the management of airlines and alliances should be able to reduce the effects of such interruptions in order to ensure good communication through air transport (i.e., maximize the robustness of their network at a reasonable cost). The literature review of the study of air transport route networks through an analysis of complex networks has highlighted a lack of contributions to the study of the topology and the robustness of such networks which contrasts, with advances undertaken for other transport networks or communication systems. This survey suggests areas in which research should be undertaken, based on the existing literature in other areas and from three different perspectives: global route networks, airline alliances, airlines and airports so as to help towards a better understanding of air traffic and, therefore, to be able to assess the potential damage of any airport being inoperative for a continent, country or airline.},

This paper proposes a dynamic pricing DR algorithm for energy management in a hierarchical electricity market that considers both service provider’s (SP) profit and customers’ (CUs) costs. Reinforcement learning (RL) is used to illustrate the hierarchical decision-making framework, in which the dynamic pricing problem is formulated as a discrete finite Markov decision process (MDP), and Q-learning is adopted to solve this decision-making problem. Using RL, the SP can adaptively decide the retail electricity price during the on-line learning process where the uncertainty of CUs’ load demand profiles and the flexibility of wholesale electricity prices are addressed. Simulation results show that this proposed DR algorithm, can promote SP profitability, reduce energy costs for CUs, balance energy supply and demand in the electricity market, and improve the reliability of electric power systems, which can be regarded as a win-win strategy for both SP and CUs.},

It offers a certain degree of philosophical elegance that is hard to dispute, and it often offers an indispensable degree of operational simplicity. Using this optimization philosophy, one approaches a complex decision problem, involving the selection of values for a number of interrelated variables, by focusing attention on a single objective designed to quantify performance and measure the quality of the decision. This one objective is maximized (or minimized, depending on the formulation) subject to the constraints that may limit the selection of decision variable values. If a suitable single aspect of a problem can be isolated and characterized by an objective, be it profit or loss in a business setting, speed or distance in a physical problem, expected return in the environment of risky investments, or social welfare in the context of government planning, optimization may provide a suitable framework for analysis.},

  abstract = {This paper studies the problem of stochastic dynamic pricing and energy management policy for electric vehicle (EV) charging service providers. In the presence of renewable energy integration and energy storage system, EV charging service providers must deal with multiple uncertainties-charging demand volatility, inherent intermittency of renewable energy generation, and wholesale electricity price fluctuation. The motivation behind our work is to offer guidelines for charging service providers to determine proper charging prices and manage electricity to balance the competing objectives of improving profitability, enhancing customer satisfaction, and reducing impact on power grid in spite of these uncertainties. We propose a new metric to assess the impact on power grid without solving complete power flow equations. To protect service providers from severe financial losses, a safeguard of profit is incorporated in the model. Two algorithms-stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) algorithm and greedy algorithm (benchmark algorithm)-are applied to derive the pricing and electricity procurement policy. A Pareto front of the multi-objective optimization is derived. Simulation results show that using SDP algorithm can achieve up to 7\% profit gain over using greedy algorithm. Additionally, we observe that the charging service provider is able to reshape spatial-temporal charging demands to reduce the impact on power grid via pricing signals.},

  abstract = {Reasoning at multiple levels of temporal abstraction is one of the key attributes of intelligence. In reinforcement learning, this is often modeled through temporally extended courses of actions called options. Options allow agents to make predictions and to operate at different levels of abstraction within an environment. Nevertheless, approaches based on the options framework often start with the assumption that a reasonable set of options is known beforehand. When this is not the case, there are no definitive answers for which options one should consider. In this paper, we argue that the successor representation, which encodes states based on the pattern of state visitation that follows them, can be seen as a natural substrate for the discovery and use of temporal abstractions. To support our claim, we take a big picture view of recent results, showing how the successor representation can be used to discover options that facilitate either temporally-extended exploration or planning. We cast these results as instantiations of a general framework for option discovery in which the agent’s representation is used to identify useful options, which are then used to further improve its representation. This results in a virtuous, never-ending, cycle in which both the representation and the options are constantly refined based on each other. Beyond option discovery itself, we also discuss how the successor representation allows us to augment a set of options into a combinatorially large counterpart without additional learning. This is achieved through the combination of previously learned options. Our empirical evaluation focuses on options discovered for temporally-extended exploration and on the use of the successor representation to combine them. Our results shed light on important design decisions involved in the definition of options and demonstrate the synergy of different methods based on the successor representation, such as eigenoptions and the option keyboard.},

This paper presents Discriminative Particle Filter Reinforcement Learning (DPFRL), a new reinforcement learning framework for complex partial observations. DPFRL encodes a differentiable particle filter in the neural network policy for explicit reasoning with partial observations over time. The particle filter maintains a belief using learned discriminative update, which is trained end-to-end for decision making. We show that using the discriminative update instead of standard generative models results in significantly improved performance, especially for tasks with complex visual observations, because they circumvent the difficulty of modeling complex observations that are irrelevant to decision making. In addition, to extract features from the particle belief, we propose a new type of belief feature based on the moment generating function. DPFRL outperforms state-of-the-art POMDP RL models in Flickering Atari Games, an existing POMDP RL benchmark, and in Natural Flickering Atari Games, a new, more challenging POMDP RL benchmark introduced in this paper. Further, DPFRL performs well for visual navigation with real-world data in the Habitat environment.},

The firm strives to maximize its total expected revenues over a finite horizon, either by choosing a dynamic pricing strategy for each product or, if prices are fixed, by selecting a dynamic rule that controls the allocation of capacity to requests for the different products. This paper shows how these well-studied revenue management problems can be reduced to a common formulation in which the firm controls the aggregate rate at which all products jointly consume resource capacity, highlighting their common structure, and in some cases leading to algorithmic simplifications through the reduction in the control dimension of the associated optimization problems. In the context of their associated deterministic (fluid) formulations, this reduction leads to a closed-form characterization of the optimal controls, and suggests several natural static and dynamic pricing heuristics. These are analyzed asymptotically and through an extensive numerical study. In the context of the former, we show that “resolving” the fluid heuristic achieves asymptotically optimal performance under fluid scaling.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we compare three different measures for computing Mahalanobis-type distances between random variables consisting of several categorical dimensions or mixed categorical and numeric dimensions – regular simplex, tensor product space, and symbolic covariance. The tensor product space and symbolic covariance distances are new contributions. We test the methods on two application domains – classification and principal components analysis. We find that the tensor product space distance is impractical with most problems. Over all, the regular simplex method is the most successful in both domains, but the symbolic covariance method has several advantages including time and space efficiency, applicability to different contexts, and theoretical neatness.},

If the representations of strong neural networks bear no resemblance to human concepts, our ability to understand faithful explanations of their decisions will be restricted, ultimately limiting what we can achieve with neural network interpretability. In this work we provide evidence that human knowledge is acquired by the AlphaZero neural network as it trains on the game of chess. By probing for a broad range of human chess concepts we show when and where these concepts are represented in the AlphaZero network. We also provide a behavioural analysis focusing on opening play, including qualitative analysis from chess Grandmaster Vladimir Kramnik. Finally, we carry out a preliminary investigation looking at the low-level details of AlphaZero's representations, and make the resulting behavioural and representational analyses available online.},

For example, oftentimes the price of a single leg flight is higher than two-leg flights that include it under similar terms of travel (class, luggage allowance, etc.). This happened for up to 24.5\% of available fares on a specific route in our dataset invalidating the common expectation that "further is more expensive". Likewise, we found several two-leg fares where buying each leg independently leads to lower overall cost than buying them together as a single ticket. This happened for up to 37\% of available fares on a specific route invalidating the common expectation that "bundling saves money". Last, several single stop tickets in which the two legs were separated by 1-5 days (called multicity fares), were oftentimes found to be costing more than corresponding back-to-back fares with a small transit time. This was found to be occurring in up to 7.5\% fares on a specific route invalidating that "a short transit is better than a longer one".},

The present work addresses partially observable environments, which violate the canonical Markov assumptions. We propose adaptations for any on-policy model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithm, in order to improve training in partially observable situations: (i) recurrent layers for including information from previous observations, (ii) predicting the step reward and the next latent representation as auxiliary outputs from the same latent space as used for inferring the action, and (iii) modification of the loss function to penalise errors in the two auxiliary outputs, in addition to the reward-based gradients used for policy training. We show that the proposed changes substantially improve learning in several environments over vanilla Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) and other baselines in literature, especially in known challenging environments with hard exploration.},

  abstract = {The global market share of electric vehicles (EVs) is on the rise, resulting in a rapid increase in their charging demand in both spatial and temporal domains. A remedy to shift the extra charging loads at peak hours to off-peak hours, caused by charging EVs at public charging stations, is an online pricing strategy. This paper presents a novel combinatorial online pricing strategy that has been established upon a reward-based model to prevent network instability and power outages. In the proposed solution, the utility provides incentives to the charging stations for their contributions in the EVs charging load shifting. Then, a constraint optimization problem is developed to minimize the total charging demand of the EVs during peak hours. To control the EVs charging demands in supporting utility’s stability and increasing the total revenue of the charging stations, treated as a multi-agent framework, an online reinforcement learning model is developed which is based on the combination of an adaptive heuristic critic and recursive least square algorithm. The effective performance of the proposed model is validated through extensive simulation studies such as qualitative, numerical, and robustness performance assessment tests. The simulation results indicate significant improvement in the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed solution in terms of utility’s power saving and charging stations’ profit.},

Existing partially observable benchmarks tend to fixate on 3D visual navigation, which is computationally expensive and only one type of POMDP. In contrast, POPGym environments are diverse, produce smaller observations, use less memory, and often converge within two hours of training on a consumer-grade GPU. We implement our high-level memory API and memory baselines on top of the popular RLlib framework, providing plug-and-play compatibility with various training algorithms, exploration strategies, and distributed training paradigms. Using POPGym, we execute the largest comparison across RL memory models to date. POPGym is available at https://github.com/proroklab/popgym.},

Analytical product release planning refers to the application of analytical methods in this process, thereby utilizing the diversity of data available from internal and external sources of information. In this chapter, information needs for release planning are outlined and a taxonomy of release planning problems is given. The paradigm of Open Innovation is introduced as a new way to elicit and gain access to relevant data related to product objectives, features and their dependencies, customers and changing priorities, as well as product values and market trends. Analytical Open Innovation (AOI) is the integration of Open Innovation with (a portfolio of) analytical methods which could be used in different problems of a semi-wicked nature such as planning and design. This chapter studies the usage of AOI in the context of release planning (RP). The respective approach called â€œAOI@RPâ€ is taking advantage of gathering and generating data and relating data into well-defined aspects of the problem and combining analytical methods to address the solution. The usage of AOI is studied in more detail for two of the concrete release planning problems given in the taxonomy: (1) Release planning in the presence of advanced feature dependencies and synergies detected from morphological analysis; (2) continuous what-to-release planning in consideration of ongoing trial feature evaluation. An illustrative case study is used as proof of concept to the proposed solution methodology.},

  abstract = {Real-world planning problems, including autonomous driving and sustainable energy applications like carbon storage and resource exploration, have recently been modeled as partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) and solved using approximate methods. To solve high-dimensional POMDPs in practice, state-of-the-art methods use online planning with problem-specific heuristics to reduce planning horizons and make the problems tractable. Algorithms that learn approximations to replace heuristics have recently found success in large-scale fully observable domains. The key insight is the combination of online Monte Carlo tree search with offline neural network approximations of the optimal policy and value function. In this work, we bring this insight to partially observable domains and propose BetaZero, a belief-state planning algorithm for high-dimensional POMDPs. BetaZero learns offline approximations that replace heuristics to enable online decision making in long-horizon problems. We address several challenges inherent in large-scale partially observable domains; namely challenges of transitioning in stochastic environments, prioritizing action branching with a limited search budget, and representing beliefs as input to the network. To formalize the use of all limited search information, we train against a novel \$Q\$-weighted visit counts policy. We test BetaZero on various well-established POMDP benchmarks found in the literature and a real-world problem of critical mineral exploration. Experiments show that BetaZero outperforms state-of-the-art POMDP solvers on a variety of tasks.},

Safe planning problems can be modeled as a chance-constrained partially observable Markov decision process (CC-POMDP) and solutions often use expensive rollouts or heuristics to estimate the optimal value and action-selection policy. This work introduces the ConstrainedZero policy iteration algorithm that solves CC-POMDPs in belief space by learning neural network approximations of the optimal value and policy with an additional network head that estimates the failure probability given a belief. This failure probability guides safe action selection during online Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS). To avoid overemphasizing search based on the failure estimates, we introduce \$\textbackslash Delta\$-MCTS, which uses adaptive conformal inference to update the failure threshold during planning. The approach is tested on a safety-critical POMDP benchmark, an aircraft collision avoidance system, and the sustainability problem of safe CO\$\_2\$ storage. Results show that by separating safety constraints from the objective we can achieve a target level of safety without optimizing the balance between rewards and costs.},

  abstract = {As electric vehicles (EVs) are slowly becoming a common occurrence on roads, commercial EV charging is becoming a standard commercial service. With this development, charging station operators are looking for ways to make their charging services more profitable or allocate the available resources optimally. Dynamic pricing is a proven technique to increase revenue in markets with heterogeneous demand. This paper proposes a Markov Decision Process (MDP)-based approach to revenue- or utilization- maximizing dynamic pricing for charging station operators. We implement the method using a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm and evaluate it in simulation using a range of problem instances based on a real-world dataset of EV charging sessions. We show that our approach provides near-optimal pricing decisions in milliseconds for large-scale problems, significantly increasing revenue or utilization over the flat-rate baseline under a range of parameters.},

Our approach focuses on the individual high-demand, fast-charging location, employing a Poisson process as a model of charging reservation arrivals, and develops an online dynamic pricing strategy optimized through a Markov Decision Process (MDP). A key contribution is the novel analysis of discretization error introduced when incorporating the continuous-time Poisson process into the discrete MDP framework. The MDP model’s feasibility is demonstrated with a heuristic dynamic pricing method based on Monte-Carlo tree search, offering a viable path for real-world applications.},

  abstract = {Controlled stochastic systems occur in science engineering, manufacturing, social sciences, and many other cntexts. If the systems is modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP) and will run ad infinitum, the optimal control policy can be computed in polynomial time using linear programming. The problems considered here assume that the time that the process will run is finite, and based on the size of the input. There are mny factors that compound the complexity of computing the optimal policy. For instance, there are many factors that compound the complexity of this computation. For instance, if the controller does not have complete information about the state of the system, or if the system is represented in some very succint manner, the optimal policy is provably not computable in time polynomial in the size of the input. We analyze the computational complexity of evaluating policies and of determining whether a sufficiently good policy exists for a MDP, based on a number of confounding factors, including the observability of the system state; the succinctness of the representation; the type of policy; even the number of actions relative to the number of states. In almost every case, we show that the decision problem is complete for some known complexity class. Some of these results are familiar from work by Papadimitriou and Tsitsiklis and others, but some, such as our PL-completeness proofs, are surprising. We include proofs of completeness for natural problems in the as yet little-studied classes NPPP.},

ActiveInference.jl is compatible with cutting-edge Julia libraries designed for cognitive and behavioural modelling, as it is used in computational psychiatry, cognitive science and neuroscience. This means that POMDP active inference models can now be easily fit to empirically observed behaviour using sampling, as well as variational methods.

  abstract = {Many problems in RL, such as meta-RL, robust RL, generalization in RL, and temporal credit assignment, can be cast as POMDPs. In theory, simply augmenting model-free RL with memory-based architectures, such as recurrent neural networks, provides a general approach to solving all types of POMDPs. However, prior work has found that such recurrent model-free RL methods tend to perform worse than more specialized algorithms that are designed for specific types of POMDPs. This paper revisits this claim. We find that careful architecture and hyperparameter decisions can often yield a recurrent model-free implementation that performs on par with (and occasionally substantially better than) more sophisticated recent techniques. We compare to 21 environments from 6 prior specialized methods and find that our implementation achieves greater sample efficiency and asymptotic performance than these methods on 18/21 environments. We also release a simple and efficient implementation of recurrent model-free RL for future work to use as a baseline for POMDPs.},

  abstract = {The rapid phase-in of electric vehicles (EV) will cause unprecedented issues with managing the supply of electricity and charging stations. It is in the interest of utility providers and everyday consumers to be able to plan for peak charging times, and related congestion. While past work has been done for localized, short-term forecasting, it has not included longer term forecasting, or considered the relationships between multiple stations. Importantly, past work has also not offered a framework for dataset construction and evaluated different dataset features. We propose a methodology to forecast demand at public EV charging stations, and use it to explore the potential of data-driven models to predict demand up to one week in advance. Our strategy includes selecting parameters for formatting a dataset given a list of charging events, a way to consider flexible prediction horizons, and deployment of deep and supervised learning-based models. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first study to propose machine learning to forecast medium-term public EV charging demand, to exploit weather and other features at public charging stations, and to forecast demand at multiple stations and the entire network. We validated our approach using data from eleven stations over three years from Scotland, UK. Our method outperforms the benchmark time series method, and predicts network demand with a symmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE) of 5.9\% and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 124.7 kWh, or less than twelve percent of average daily demand.},

In particular, deep learning methods have emerged as the state of the art method in many important breakthroughs [18, 20, 28]. This is due to the statistical flexibility and computational scalability of large and deep neural networks which allows them to harness the information of large and rich datasets. At the same time, elementary decision theory shows that the only admissible decision rules are Bayesian [5, 30]. Colloquially, this means that any decision rule which is not Bayesian can be strictly improved (or even exploited) by some Bayesian alternative [6]. The implication of these results is clear: combine deep learning with Bayesian inference for the best decisions from data.},

Based on the convexity, we design a value-iteration algorithm for finding the robust policy. We prove that our value iteration converges for an infinite horizon.

Like other such programs, however, CPP is not free from the payback phenomenon: a rise in consumption after a critical event. This payback has a negative effect on profits and thus must be appropriately considered when designing a CPP scheme. However, few studies have examined CPP scheme design considering payback. This study thus characterizes payback using three parameters (duration, amount, and pattern) and examines payback effects on the optimal schedule of critical events and on the optimal peak rate for two specific payback patterns. This analysis is verified through numerical simulations. The results demonstrate the need to properly consider payback parameters when designing a profit-maximizing CPP scheme.},

  abstract = {Intelligent agents need to remember salient information to reason in partially-observed environments. For example, agents with a first-person view should remember the positions of relevant objects even if they go out of view. Similarly, to effectively navigate through rooms agents need to remember the floor plan of how rooms are connected. However, most benchmark tasks in reinforcement learning do not test long-term memory in agents, slowing down progress in this important research direction. In this paper, we introduce the Memory Maze, a 3D domain of randomized mazes specifically designed for evaluating long-term memory in agents. Unlike existing benchmarks, Memory Maze measures long-term memory separate from confounding agent abilities and requires the agent to localize itself by integrating information over time. With Memory Maze, we propose an online reinforcement learning benchmark, a diverse offline dataset, and an offline probing evaluation. Recording a human player establishes a strong baseline and verifies the need to build up and retain memories, which is reflected in their gradually increasing rewards within each episode. We find that current algorithms benefit from training with truncated backpropagation through time and succeed on small mazes, but fall short of human performance on the large mazes, leaving room for future algorithmic designs to be evaluated on the Memory Maze.},

  abstract = {Dynamic pricing for preemptible cloud services (DPPCS) is highly demanded to effectively utilize the excess capacity in cloud computing. However, the dynamic nature of excess capacity exhibits high non-stationarity, which is characterized by multi-temporal stochastic patterns with time-varying statistical properties. The non-stationarity results in the DPPCS problem being a Non-Stationary Markov Decision Process (NSMDP) with unknown transition probabilities. Moreover, DPPCS is constrained by a certain maximum preemption rate, further complicating the DPPCS problem as a Constrained NSMDP (CNSMDP). We transform the CNSMDP into a piecewise Lagrangian dual model, which converts the CNSMDP into an unconstrained optimization problem. To solve the above problem, we propose a novel Q-Learning approach for DPPCS. We first present estimation methods for the unknown environment parameters, including a detection method for identifying temporal pattern changes, and a diffusion approximation method for estimating the actual preemption rate. Then, we introduce a Lagrange multiplier updating method, which can strike a balance between revenue and the preemption rate in the reward function. Building upon the above methods, we develop a Constrained Non-Stationary Q-Learning (CNSQL) algorithm for DPPCS, which dynamically adjusts its learning process to adapt to the multi-temporal patterns. Through simulated experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach compared to state-of-the-art algorithms. It performs well in improving revenue generated from excess capacity while maintaining the actual preemption rate within the specified constraint.},

Our goal is to address the competitive aspect of the problem together with demand uncertainty using ideas from robust optimization and variational inequalities. The demand function for each seller has some associated uncertainty and we assume that the sellers would like to adopt a policy that is robust to adverse uncertain circumstances. We believe this is the first paper that uses robust optimization for dynamic pricing under competition. In particular, starting with a given fixed inventory, each seller competes over a multi-period time horizon in the market by setting prices and protection levels for each period at the beginning of the time horizon. Any unsold inventory at the end of the horizon is worthless. The sellers do not have the option of periodically reviewing and replenishing their inventory. We study non-cooperative Nash equilibrium policies for sellers under such a model. This kind of a setup can be used to model pricing of air fares, hotel reservations, bandwidth in communication networks, etc. In this paper we demonstrate our results through some numerical examples.},

Using these measures a system that performs worse in the objective sense of Informedness, can appear to perform better under any of these commonly used measures. We discuss several concepts and measures that reflect the probability that prediction is informed versus chance. Informedness and introduce Markedness as a dual measure for the probability that prediction is marked versus chance. Finally we demonstrate elegant connections between the concepts of Informedness, Markedness, Correlation and Significance as well as their intuitive relationships with Recall and Precision, and outline the extension from the dichotomous case to the general multi-class case.},

  abstract = {An introduction to category theory as a rigorous, flexible, and coherent modeling language that can be used across the sciences.                 Category theory was invented in the 1940s to unify and synthesize different areas in mathematics, and it has proven remarkably successful in enabling powerful communication between disparate fields and subfields within mathematics. This book shows that category theory can be useful outside of mathematics as a rigorous, flexible, and coherent modeling language throughout the sciences. Information is inherently dynamic; the same ideas can be organized and reorganized in countless ways, and the ability to translate between such organizational structures is becoming increasingly important in the sciences. Category theory offers a unifying framework for information modeling that can facilitate the translation of knowledge between disciplines.Written in an engaging and straightforward style, and assuming little background in mathematics, the book is rigorous but accessible to non-mathematicians. Using databases as an entry to category theory, it begins with sets and functions, then introduces the reader to notions that are fundamental in mathematics: monoids, groups, orders, and graphs—categories in disguise. After explaining the “big three” concepts of category theory—categories, functors, and natural transformations—the book covers other topics, including limits, colimits, functor categories, sheaves, monads, and operads. The book explains category theory by examples and exercises rather than focusing on theorems and proofs. It includes more than 300 exercises, with solutions.                     Category Theory for the Sciences is intended to create a bridge between the vast array of mathematical concepts used by mathematicians and the models and frameworks of such scientific disciplines as computation, neuroscience, and physics.},

  abstract = {Abstract This paper discusses the application of Pugh matrices in concept selections within the subsea processing department of FMC Technologies. The focus is not the concepts themselves or requirements management, but on applying Pugh matrices in conceptual system studies. Previous research by Master students in the oil \& gas industry shows resistance amongst engineers and managers towards using Pugh matrices. The application of the Pugh matrix in these studies showed that if applied on the correct level of detail as part of the concept selection process, it is a powerful tool. It forces reasoning to be based on explicit criteria and also serves the purpose of documenting the decision making. This level of documentation and definition/selection of criteria goes beyond the normal practice today. The study teams gained a broader and deeper understanding of the design problems in addition to securing the quality of the concept selection process. The involved engineers readily adopted the Pugh matrix and they intend to continue using it, mainly due to its ability to force structural thinking in complex systems.}

  abstract = {Learning predictive world models is crucial for enhancing the planning capabilities of reinforcement learning (RL) agents. Recently, MuZero-style algorithms, leveraging the value equivalence principle and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), have achieved superhuman performance in various domains. However, these methods struggle to scale in heterogeneous scenarios with diverse dependencies and task variability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce UniZero, a novel approach that employs a modular transformer-based world model to effectively learn a shared latent space. By concurrently predicting latent dynamics and decision-oriented quantities conditioned on the learned latent history, UniZero enables joint optimization of the long-horizon world model and policy, facilitating broader and more efficient planning in the latent space. We show that UniZero significantly outperforms existing baselines in benchmarks that require long-term memory. Additionally, UniZero demonstrates superior scalability in multitask learning experiments conducted on Atari benchmarks. In standard single-task RL settings, such as Atari and DMControl, UniZero matches or even surpasses the performance of current state-of-the-art methods. Finally, extensive ablation studies and visual analyses validate the effectiveness and scalability of UniZero's design choices.

As the electric vehicles arrive randomly at a charging facility with uncertain demand and completion deadlines, the charging station operator continuously faces the task to adjust the price of charging to maximize profit. If prices are too high, the demand will be low, and hence, the average profit will be marginal. In contrast if prices are low, the charging station is losing on the additional profit had the prices been higher. Thus, at each demand, there is a corresponding price which will maximize the profit. In order to determine the profit maximizing price, we run price experiment in which the agent learns about the demand and profit-maximizing price by interacting with the environment and receiving the reward. We transform the problem as non-stationary multi-armed bandit reinforcement learning problem that can deal with demand uncertainty and cost with the objective of maximizing expected average profit. Numerical simulations validate the performance of our pricing scheme.},

Existing studies are mostly based on travel data from conventional internal combustion engine vehicles, modeled with assumed and simplified charging scenarios. The use of public charging infrastructure is often neglected. Few studies evaluate real-world charging behaviors of EVs currently in operation using public charging stations. To address this gap, this study analyzes the data of 39,372 charging events from 129 unique electric taxis in Shenzhen, China to study the distributions of daily charging frequency, charging start time, and charging duration. The insights we learned from this study are: 1) the daily frequency for a vehicle to visit charging stations is unlikely to exceed five times; 2) the distribution of charging start time have multiple peaks and can be fitted with Gaussian Mixture Models; 3) charging duration is influenced by charging start time; and 4) charging dynamics can be modeled using the distributions of daily charging frequency, charging start time, and charging duration. Results from this study can inform charging behavior modeling for EVs and charging infrastructure development.},

  abstract = {The transition of the automotive sector to electric vehicles (EVs) necessitates research on charging demand forecasting for optimal station placement and capacity planning. In the literature, extensive studies have been conducted on model-based and probabilistic EV charging demand forecasting schemes. The studies provide a solid research foundation but result in complicated models with limited scalability. Meanwhile, emerging machine learning techniques bring promising prospects, yet exhibit suboptimal performance with insufficient data. Additionally, existing studies often overlook several critical areas such as overcoming data scarcity, security and privacy concerns, managing the inherent stochasticity of demand data, selecting forecasting methods for a specific feature, and developing standardized performance metrics. Considering the impact of the research topic, EV charging demand forecasting demands careful study. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of EV charging demand forecasting, focusing on both probabilistic and learning algorithms. First, we introduce the general procedure of EV charging demand forecasting, encompassing data sources, data pre-processing, and the key EV features. We then provide a taxonomy of existing EV charging demand forecasting techniques, followed by a critical analysis and comparative study of state-of-the-art research. Finally, we discuss open issues, which offer useful insights and future direction for various stakeholders.},

  abstract = {Objective: The objective of the present research was to increase understanding of the phenomenon of range anxiety and to determine the degree to which practical experience with battery electric vehicles (BEVs) reduces different levels of range anxiety. Background: Limited range is a challenge for BEV users. A frequently discussed phenomenon in this context is range anxiety. There is some evidence suggesting that range anxiety might be a problem only for inexperienced BEV drivers and, therefore, might decrease with practical experience. Method: We compared 12 motorists with high BEV driving experience (M = 60,500 km) with 12 motorists who had never driven a BEV before. The test drive was designed to lead to a critical range situation (remaining range {$<$} trip length). We examined range appraisal and range stress (i.e., range anxiety) on different levels (cognitive, emotional, and behavioral). Results: Experienced BEV drivers exhibited less negative range appraisal and range anxiety than inexperienced BEV drivers, revealing significant, strong effects for all but one variable. Conclusion: Hence, BEV driving experience (defined as absolute kilometers driven with a BEV) seems to be one important variable that predicts less range anxiety. Application: In order to reduce range anxiety in BEV drivers even when there is a critical range situation, it is important to increase efficiency and effectiveness of the learning process.},

In this paper, we study abstraction in the continuous-control setting. We extend the definition of MDP homomorphisms to encompass continuous actions in continuous state spaces. We derive a policy gradient theorem on the abstract MDP, which allows us to leverage approximate symmetries of the environment for policy optimization. Based on this theorem, we propose an actor-critic algorithm that is able to learn the policy and the MDP homomorphism map simultaneously, using the lax bisimulation metric. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on benchmark tasks in the DeepMind Control Suite. Our method's ability to utilize MDP homomorphisms for representation learning leads to improved performance when learning from pixel observations.},

  abstract = {Many sequential decision-making problems that are currently automated, such as those in manufacturing or recommender systems, operate in an environment where there is either little uncertainty, or zero risk of catastrophe. As companies and researchers attempt to deploy autonomous systems in less constrained environments, it is increasingly important that we endow sequential decision-making algorithms with the ability to reason about uncertainty and risk. In this thesis, we will address both planning and reinforcement learning (RL) approaches to sequential decision-making. In the planning setting, it is assumed that a model of the environment is provided, and a policy is optimised within that model. Reinforcement learning relies upon extensive random exploration, and therefore usually requires a simulator in which to perform training. In many real-world domains, it is impossible to construct a perfectly accurate model or simulator. Therefore, the performance of any policy is inevitably uncertain due to the incomplete knowledge about the environment. Furthermore, in stochastic domains, the outcome of any given run is also uncertain due to the inherent randomness of the environment. These two sources of uncertainty are usually classified as epistemic, and aleatoric uncertainty, respectively. The over-arching goal of this thesis is to contribute to developing algorithms that mitigate both sources of uncertainty in sequential decision-making problems. We make a number of contributions towards this goal, with a focus on model-based algorithms...},

  abstract = {We develop an online mechanism for the allocation of an expiring resource to a dynamic agent population. Each agent has a non-increasing marginal valuation function for the resource, and an upper limit on the number of units that can be allocated in any period. We propose two versions on a truthful allocation mechanism. Each modifies the decisions of a greedy online assignment algorithm by sometimes cancelling an  allocation of resources. One version makes this modification immediately upon an allocation decision while a second waits until the point at which an agent departs the market. Adopting a prior-free framework, we show that the  second approach has better worst-case allocative efficiency and is more scalable. On the other hand, the first approach (with immediate cancellation) may be easier in practice because it does not need to reclaim units previously allocated. We consider an application to recharging plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). Using data from a real-world trial of PHEVs in the UK, we demonstrate higher system performance than a fixed price system, performance  comparable with a standard, but non-truthful scheduling heuristic, and the ability to support 50\% more vehicles at the same fuel cost than a simple randomized policy.},

  abstract = {Dynamic pricing plays an important role in modern Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) in solving problems such as congestion control, peak load reduction, mobility management of traditional or Electric Vehicles (EVs) in cost-effective manner. It also facilitates the construction of an eco-friendly environment in the society by optimized route planning of vehicles. However, framing dynamic pricing strategies for ITS has always been a challenging task keeping in view of various constraints. An in-efficient dynamic pricing technique may lead to the mismanagement of vehicles, which results an increase in the waiting time of vehicles, an increase in air and noise pollution, wastage of electric and other sources of energies. On the contrary, efficient dynamic pricing strategies can provide satisfaction to all stakeholders, including service providers and service consumers. Motivated from these facts, this paper presents an extensive literature review and analysis of dynamic pricing techniques used in the literature for ITS. The analysis presented in the paper gives new insights to the readers for the applications of one of the techniques in comparison to its merits over the others. Various problems solved by the dynamic pricing techniques, importance of various evaluation parameters, limitations of dynamic pricing techniques and their applications are discussed in-depth in this paper. Different taxonomies used for exploring various issues of dynamic pricing are also presented in a structured manner. Moreover, advantages and limitations of various dynamic pricing techniques are explored and discussed in the paper. Finally, existing challenges and future research directions of dynamic pricing in ITS are presented.},

  abstract = {Routing of a fleet of automated unit-occupancy vehicles in a capacitated transportation network is an emerging problem that needs to be addressed to realize large-scale automated transportation systems. We adopt an existing network-flow-based model for the problem and present a new reformulation based on Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition. This reformulation allows us to apply the column generation solution technique which, in turn, enables us to solve large-scale problem instances with tens of thousands of requests on networks with thousands of links. We empirically compare our method to the state-of-the-art approach on several standard benchmark instances and find that the computational time of our solution approach scales qualitatively better in all tested problem instance parameters: namely, in the size of the transportation network, in the magnitude of demand intensity, and in the number of demand flows.},

  abstract = {Constructing agents with planning capabilities has long been one of the main challenges in the pursuit of artificial intelligence. Tree-based planning methods have enjoyed huge success in challenging domains, such as chess1 and Go2, where a perfect simulator is available. However, in real-world problems, the dynamics governing the environment are often complex and unknown. Here we present the MuZero algorithm, which, by combining a tree-based search with a learned model, achieves superhuman performance in a range of challenging and visually complex domains, without any knowledge of their underlying dynamics. The MuZero algorithm learns an iterable model that produces predictions relevant to planning: the action-selection policy, the value function and the reward. When evaluated on 57 different Atari games3—the canonical video game environment for testing artificial intelligence techniques, in which model-based planning approaches have historically struggled4—the MuZero algorithm achieved state-of-the-art performance. When evaluated on Go, chess and shogi—canonical environments for high-performance planning—the MuZero algorithm matched, without any knowledge of the game dynamics, the superhuman performance of the AlphaZero algorithm5 that was supplied with the rules of the game. A reinforcement-learning algorithm that combines a tree-based search with a learned model achieves superhuman performance in high-performance planning and visually complex domains, without any knowledge of their underlying dynamics.},

The motivation behind the proposed algorithm is to comprehensively describe a charging market from both drivers' point of view to reduce range anxiety and enhance customer satisfaction and charge station providers' point of view to manage charging station properly and improve profitability. The proposed DSS algorithm obtains all the required data to find the best station in terms of the influential parameters given by the candidate stations. A fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making (FMCDM) method that is utilized in the proposed DSS algorithm is deployed for evaluating the parameters and deciding for the best charging station. Moreover, the proposed CSM algorithm of each charging station is utilized to maximize its profitability by taking into account the charge, reserve, and discount prices with respect to the reaction of EV drivers. The Monte Carlo simulations are applied to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in comparison with a designed benchmark algorithm.},

  abstract = {In this work, we consider the popular tree-based search strategy within the framework of reinforcement learning, the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), in the context of infinite-horizon discounted cost Markov Decision Process (MDP). While MCTS is believed to provide an approximate value function for a given state with enough simulations, the claimed proof in the seminal works is incomplete. This is due to the fact that the variant, the Upper Confidence Bound for Trees (UCT), analyzed in prior works utilizes "logarithmic" bonus term for balancing exploration and exploitation within the tree-based search, following the insights from stochastic multi-arm bandit (MAB) literature. In effect, such an approach assumes that the regret of the underlying recursively dependent non-stationary MABs concentrates around their mean exponentially in the number of steps, which is unlikely to hold as pointed out in literature, even for stationary MABs. As the key contribution of this work, we establish polynomial concentration property of regret for a class of non-stationary MAB. This in turn establishes that the MCTS with appropriate polynomial rather than logarithmic bonus term in UCB has the claimed property. Using this as a building block, we argue that MCTS, combined with nearest neighbor supervised learning, acts as a "policy improvement" operator: it iteratively improves value function approximation for all states, due to combining with supervised learning, despite evaluating at only finitely many states. In effect, we establish that to learn an \$\textbackslash varepsilon\$ approximation of the value function with respect to \$\textbackslash ell\_\textbackslash infty\$ norm, MCTS combined with nearest neighbor requires a sample size scaling as \$\textbackslash widetilde\{O\}\textbackslash big(\textbackslash varepsilon\textasciicircum\{-(d+4)\}\textbackslash big)\$, where \$d\$ is the dimension of the state space. This is nearly optimal due to a minimax lower bound of \$\textbackslash widetilde\{\textbackslash Omega\}\textbackslash big(\textbackslash varepsilon\textasciicircum\{-(d+2)\}\textbackslash big)\$.},

  abstract = {Learning to act in an unknown partially observable domain is a difficult variant of the reinforcement learning paradigm. Research in the area has focused on model-free methods — methods that learn a policy without learning a model of the world. When sensor noise increases, model-free methods provide less accurate policies. The model-based approach — learning a POMDP model of the world, and computing an optimal policy for the learned model — may generate superior results in the presence of sensor noise, but learning and solving a model of the environment is a difficult problem. We have previously shown how such a model can be obtained from the learned policy of model-free methods, but this approach implies a distinction between a learning phase and an acting phase that is undesirable. In this paper we present a novel method for learning a POMDP model online, based on McCallums’ Utile Suffix Memory (USM), in conjunction with an approximate policy obtained using an incremental POMDP solver. We show that the incrementally improving policy provides superior results to the original USM algorithm, especially in the presence of increasing sensor and action noise.},

This cognitive process can be modeled computationally using program induction in a Hierarchical Bayesian framework that explicitly reasons about uncertainty with strong spatial priors. Using a new behavioral Map Induction Task, we demonstrate that this computational framework explains human exploration behavior better than non-inductive models and outperforms state-of-the-art planning algorithms when applied to a realistic spatial navigation domain.},

We recently established a method for selecting the bin width of the time-histogram, based on the principle of minimizing the mean integrated square error (MISE) between the estimated rate and unknown underlying rate. Here we apply the same optimization principle to the kernel density estimation in selecting the width or “bandwidth” of the kernel, and further extend the algorithm to allow a variable bandwidth, in conformity with data. The variable kernel has the potential to accurately grasp non-stationary phenomena, such as abrupt changes in the firing rate, which we often encounter in neuroscience. In order to avoid possible overfitting that may take place due to excessive freedom, we introduced a stiffness constant for bandwidth variability. Our method automatically adjusts the stiffness constant, thereby adapting to the entire set of spike data. It is revealed that the classical kernel smoother may exhibit goodness-of-fit comparable to, or even better than, that of modern sophisticated rate estimation methods, provided that the bandwidth is selected properly for a given set of spike data, according to the optimization methods presented here.},

Indeed, EVs can actively reinforce the development of the smart grid if their charging processes are properly coordinated through two-way communications, possibly benefiting all types of actors. Because grid systems involve a large number of actors with nonaligned objectives, we focus on the economic and incentive aspects, where each actor behaves in its own interest. We indeed believe that the market structure will directly impact the actors' behaviors, and as a result, the total benefits that the presence of EVs can earn in the society, hence the need for a careful design. This survey provides an overview of economic models considering unidirectional energy flows and bidirectional energy flows, i.e., with EVs temporarily providing energy to the grid. We describe and compare the main approaches, summarize the requirements on the supporting communication systems, and propose a classification to highlight the most important results and lacks.},

This paper introduces an efficient active exploration algorithm, Model-Based Active eXploration (MAX), which uses an ensemble of forward models to plan to observe novel events. This is carried out by optimizing agent behaviour with respect to a measure of novelty derived from the Bayesian perspective of exploration, which is estimated using the disagreement between the futures predicted by the ensemble members. We show empirically that in semi-random discrete environments where directed exploration is critical to make progress, MAX is at least an order of magnitude more efficient than strong baselines. MAX scales to high-dimensional continuous environments where it builds task-agnostic models that can be used for any downstream task.},

One of objectives of the study was to describe user charging behaviour from a geographic perspective to model where users prefer to charge in the area studied according to the variables that may affect decisions. Another objective was to estimate the number of electric vehicles in Turin and the characteristics of their users, both of which are helpful in understanding electric mobility within a city. Analysing these behavioural issues in a modelling framework can provide a set of tools to compare and evaluate a variety of possible modifications, indicating an adequate network of charging infrastructure to facilitate the diffusion of electric vehicles.},

  abstract = {The theoretical impact of the electric vehicle (EV) market share growth has been widely discussed with regards to technical and socioeconomic aspects in recent years. However, the prospection of EV scenarios is a challenge, and the difficulty increases with the granularity of the study and the set of variables affected by user behavior and regional aspects. Moreover, the lack of a robust database to estimate fast-charging stations’ load curves, for example, affects the quality of planning, allocation, or grid impact studies. When this problem is evaluated on highways, the challenge increases due to the reduced number of trips related to the reduced number of charger units installed and the limited EVs range, which influence user anxiety. This paper presents a methodology to estimate the highway fast-charging station operation condition, considering regional and EV user aspects. The process is based in a block of traffic simulation, considering the traffic information and highway patterns composing the matrix solution model. Also, the output block estimates charging stations’ operational conditions, considering infrastructure scenarios and simulated traffic. A Monte Carlo simulation is presented to model entrance rates and charging times, considering the PDF of stochastic inputs. The results are shown for the aspects of load curve and queue length for one case study, and a sensibility study was conducted to evaluate the impact of model inputs.},

  abstract = {The game of Go has long been viewed as the most challenging of classic games for artificial intelligence owing to its enormous search space and the difficulty of evaluating board positions and moves. Here we introduce a new approach to computer Go that uses ‘value networks’ to evaluate board positions and ‘policy networks’ to select moves. These deep neural networks are trained by a novel combination of supervised learning from human expert games, and reinforcement learning from games of self-play. Without any lookahead search, the neural networks play Go at the level of state-of-the-art Monte Carlo tree search programs that simulate thousands of random games of self-play. We also introduce a new search algorithm that combines Monte Carlo simulation with value and policy networks. Using this search algorithm, our program AlphaGo achieved a 99.8\% winning rate against other Go programs, and defeated the human European Go champion by 5 games to 0. This is the first time that a computer program has defeated a human professional player in the full-sized game of Go, a feat previously thought to be at least a decade away.},

  abstract = {Our work is motivated by a common business constraint in the retail industry. While retailers respect the advantages of dynamic pricing and price experimentation, they must limit the number of price changes (i.e., switches) to be within some range due to various practical reasons.We study the classical price-based network revenue management problem, where a retailer has finite initial inventory of multiple resources to sell over a finite time horizon. We consider both known and unknown demand distribution settings, and derive policies with limited switches that achieve the best-possible asymptotic performance in both settings. Our results suggest an intrinsic difference between the expected revenue associated with how many switches are allowed: in the distributionally-known setting, a resource-dependent amount of switching budget proves to be  a sharp threshold for achieving sublinear revenue loss; and in the distributionally-unknown setting, a resource-dependent piecewise-constant function of the switching budget proves to completely characterize the  optimal regret rate.To the best of our knowledge, our results are the first to exhibit a separation in regret rates between online learning problems with different number of inventory constraints. Practically, retailers may benefit from our study in designing their budgets of price switches.},

  abstract = {Object-centric world models provide structured representation of the scene and can be an important backbone in reinforcement learning and planning. However, existing approaches suffer in partially-observable environments due to the lack of belief states. In this paper, we propose Structured World Belief, a model for learning and inference of object-centric belief states. Inferred by Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC), our belief states provide multiple object-centric scene hypotheses. To synergize the benefits of SMC particles with object representations, we also propose a new object-centric dynamics model that considers the inductive bias of object permanence. This enables tracking of object states even when they are invisible for a long time. To further facilitate object tracking in this regime, we allow our model to attend flexibly to any spatial location in the image which was restricted in previous models. In experiments, we show that object-centric belief provides a more accurate and robust performance for filtering and generation. Furthermore, we show the efficacy of structured world belief in improving the performance of reinforcement learning, planning and supervised reasoning.},

  abstract = {We consider settings where owners of electric vehicles (EVs) participate in a market mechanism to charge their vehicles. Existing work on such mechanisms has typically assumed that participants are fully rational and can report their preferences accurately to the mechanism or to a software agent participating on their behalf. However, this may not be reasonable in settings with non-expert human end-users. To explore this, we compare a fully expressive interface that covers the entire space of preferences to two restricted interfaces that reduce the space of possible options. To enable this analysis, we develop a novel game that replicates key features of an abstract EV charging scenario. In two extensive evaluations with over 300 users, we show that restricting the users' preferences significantly reduces the time they spend deliberating. More surprisingly, it also leads to an increase in their utility compared to the fully expressive interface (up to 70\%). Finally, we find that a reinforcement learning agent displays similar performance trends, enabling a novel methodology for evaluating market interfaces.},

  abstract = {To support power grid operators to detect and evaluate potential power grid congestions due to the electrification of urban private cars, accurate models are needed to determine the charging energy and power demand of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) with high spatial and temporal resolution. Typically, e-mobility traffic simulations are used for this purpose. In particular, activity-based mobility models are used because they individually model the activity and travel patterns of each person in the considered geographical area. In addition to inaccuracies in determining the spatial distribution of BEV charging demand, one main limitation of the activity-based models proposed in the literature is that they rely on data describing traffic flow in the considered area. However, these data are not available for most places in the world. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel approach to develop an activity-based model that overcomes the spatial limitations and does not require traffic flow data as an input parameter. Instead, a route assignment procedure assigns a destination to each BEV trip based on the evaluation of all possible destinations. The basis of this evaluation is the travel distance and speed between the origin of the trip and the destination, as well as the car-access attractiveness and the availability of parking spots at the destinations. The applicability of this model is demonstrated for the urban area of Berlin, Germany, and its 448 sub-districts. For each district in Berlin, both the required daily BEV charging energy demand and the power demand are determined. In addition, the load shifting potential is investigated for an exemplary district. The results show that peak power demand can be reduced by up to 31.7\% in comparison to uncontrolled charging.},

In this paper, we portray these developments by reviewing the key literature on choice-based revenue management, specifically focusing on methodological publications of availability control over the years 2004–2017. For this purpose, we first state the choice-based network revenue management problem by formulating the underlying dynamic program, and structure the review according to its components and the resulting inherent challenges. In particular, we first focus on the demand modeling by giving an overview of popular choice models, discussing their properties, and describing estimation procedures relevant to choice-based revenue management. Second, we elaborate on assortment optimization, which is a fundamental component of the problem. Third, we describe recent developments on tackling the entire control problem. We also discuss the relation to dynamic pricing. Finally, we give directions for future research.},

Based on traffic flow model and M/M/s queuing theory, this paper presents a mathematical model for the prediction of charging load at charging station. To get the charging distribution generated in the driving process, an optimal path planning model based on the Dijkstra algorithm is proposed. Besides, for the sake of formulating the dynamic spatial charging demand distribution map of the traffic network region, the Monte Carlo sampling method is adopted. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed models in analyzing the charging demand distribution.},

  abstract = {This paper develops a model of dynamic pricing with endogenous intertemporal demand. In the model, there is a monopolist who sells a finite inventory over a finite time horizon. The seller adjusts prices dynamically to maximize revenue. Customers arrive continually over the duration of the selling season. At each point in time, customers may purchase the product at current prices, remain in the market at a cost to purchase later, or exit, and they wish to maximize individual utility. The customer population is heterogeneous along two dimensions: they may have different valuations for the product and different degrees of patience (waiting costs).We demonstrate that heterogeneity in both valuation and patience is important because they jointly determine the structure of optimal pricing policies. In particular, when high-value customers are proportionately less patient, markdown pricing policies are effective because the high-value customers would buy early at high prices while the low-value customers are willing to wait (i.e., they are not lost). On the other hand, when the high-value customers are more patient than the low-value customers, prices should increase over time to discourage inefficient waiting. Contrary to intuition, we find that strategic waiting by customers may sometimes benefit the seller: when low-value customers wait, they compete for availability with high-value customers and thus increase their willingness to pay. Our results also shed light on how the composition of the customer population affects optimal revenue, consumer surplus, and social welfare. Finally, we consider the long-run problem of selecting the optimal initial stocking quantity.},

There is a need for an in-depth understanding of the electrification of transportation in the industrial environment. It is important to consolidate the practical and the conceptual knowledge of industrial informatics in order to support the emerging electric vehicle (EV) technologies. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the electrification of transportation in an industrial environment. In addition, it provides a comprehensive survey of the EVs in the field of industrial informatics systems, namely: 1) charging infrastructure and PHEV/PEV batteries; 2) intelligent energy management; 3) vehicle-to-grid; and 4) communication requirements.

  abstract = {The agent learns to organize decision behavior to achieve a behavioral goal, such as reward maximization, and reinforcement learning is often used for this optimization. Learning an optimal behavioral strategy is difficult under the uncertainty that events necessary for learning are only partially observable, called as Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). However, the real-world environment also gives many events irrelevant to reward delivery and an optimal behavioral strategy. The conventional methods in POMDP, which attempt to infer transition rules among the entire observations, including irrelevant states, are ineffective in such an environment. Supposing Redundantly Observable Markov Decision Process (ROMDP), here we propose a method for goal-oriented reinforcement learning to efficiently learn state transition rules among reward-related "core states'' from redundant observations. Starting with a small number of initial core states, our model gradually adds new core states to the transition diagram until it achieves an optimal behavioral strategy consistent with the Bellman equation. We demonstrate that the resultant inference model outperforms the conventional method for POMDP. We emphasize that our model only containing the core states has high explainability. Furthermore, the proposed method suits online learning as it suppresses memory consumption and improves learning speed.},

  abstract = {Over the last few years, load growth, increases in intermittent generation, declining technology costs and increasing recognition of the importance of customer behaviour in energy markets have brought about a change in the focus of Demand Response (DR) in Europe. The long standing programmes involving large industries, through interruptible tariffs and time of day pricing, have been increasingly complemented by programmes aimed at commercial and residential customer groups. Developments in DR vary substantially across Europe reflecting national conditions and triggered by different sets of policies, programmes and implementation schemes. This paper examines experiences within European countries as well as at European Union (EU) level, with the aim of understanding which factors have facilitated or impeded advances in DR. It describes initiatives, studies and policies of various European countries, with in-depth case studies of the UK, Italy and Spain. It is concluded that while business programmes, technical and economic potentials vary across Europe, there are common reasons as to why coordinated DR policies have been slow to emerge. This is because of the limited knowledge on DR energy saving capacities; high cost estimates for DR technologies and infrastructures; and policies focused on creating the conditions for liberalising the EU energy markets.},

Our simulation tool is implemented in C++ and we can easily run ABCEM models with several million agents. The object-oriented software design enables the isolated implementation of building blocks for ABCEM models, such as agent types and market mechanisms. The user can design and compare ABCEM models in a unified environment by recombining existing building blocks using the XML-based SABCEMM configuration file. We introduce an abstract ABCEM model class which our simulation tool is built upon. Furthermore, we present the software architecture as well as computational aspects of SABCEMM. Here, we focus on the efficiency of SABCEMM with respect to the run time of our simulations. We show the great impact of different random number generators on the run time of ABCEM models.

  date = {2013-12-16},
  abstract = {Effective security of today’s transportation infrastructures is difficult to achieve without computer- aided approach. We develop a set of security-enhancing computational methods for transportation infrastructures where many independent agents operate on daily basis in presence of an intruder. Specifically, we consider an interaction between two agents representing two principal conflict- ing sides: an evading agent (Evader) moving through the infrastructure to reach a destination and an intercepting agent (Defender), aiming to detect the evading agent and prevent him from reaching the destination, motivated by scenarios of contemporary maritime piracy, border patrol, terrorist attacks or drug trafficking. We model the problem within the game-theoretic framework as a two-player zero-sum game on a graph in normal form while considering different mobility modes of the Defender. Due to huge strategy spaces of both players, we utilize iterative oracle-based algorithms to compute a Nash Equilibrium of the game: we design a set of oracles for each player, we decompose the algorithm template into two principal phases, provide an extension of the algorithm template to work with oracle hierarchies, and utilize fast suboptimal oracles without losing optimality guarantees. We step outside the game-theoretic framework when considering multiple evading agents and propose grouping mechanism to group agents together when transiting the area, taking into ac- count their speeds and risk aversion. We design different constraint sets and formulate a bi- objective mixed-integer linear program to compute optimal grouping. Finally, we present a computational model of the maritime domain in the form of an agent- based simulation. We model the maritime traffic in the Indian Ocean with the merchant vessel adopting the role of the evading agent and with pirates, adopting the role of the intercepting agent. All algorithms are evaluated within the simulation framework with different space and time abstractions, with slight violation of assumptions made and with a perturbation of parameters fixed in the mathematical models. The results show robustness of formal mathematical models and their possible utilization for scenarios shifted from the original problem.},

Previous works have shown that user-generated content can be automatically analyzed to extract useful information for the society. Nevertheless, researchers have also shown that it is possible to build individual user profiles automatically. This situation may provoke concerns to the users worried about their privacy. In this paper, we present a new scheme that effectively obfuscates the real user’s profile in front of automatic profiling systems, while maintaining her publications intact in order to interfere the least with her readers. The proposed system generates and publishes fake messages with terms semantically correlated with user posts to distort and, hence, hide the real profile. Our method has been tested using Twitter, a very well-known Web 2.0 microblogging platform. Evaluation results show that this new scheme effectively distorts user profiles, producing uniform (i.e. balanced) profiles that hardly characterize users and outperforming simpler methods based on random distortions. In addition to that, the presented system is adaptive, capable of profiling and anonymizing users with a quite limited number of publications and it reacts quickly to any variation in their interests.},

  abstract = {Many real-world applications require artificial agents to compete and coordinate with other agents in complex environments. As a stepping stone to this goal, the domain of StarCraft has emerged as an important challenge for artificial intelligence research, owing to its iconic and enduring status among the most difficult professional esports and its relevance to the real world in terms of its raw complexity and multi-agent challenges. Over the course of a decade and numerous competitions1–3, the strongest agents have simplified important aspects of the game, utilized superhuman capabilities, or employed hand-crafted sub-systems4. Despite these advantages, no previous agent has come close to matching the overall skill of top StarCraft players. We chose to address the challenge of StarCraft using general-purpose learning methods that are in principle applicable to other complex domains: a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm that uses data from both human and agent games within a diverse league of continually adapting strategies and counter-strategies, each represented by deep neural networks5,6. We evaluated our agent, AlphaStar, in the full game of StarCraft II, through a series of online games against human players. AlphaStar was rated at Grandmaster level for all three StarCraft races and above 99.8\% of officially ranked human players.},

In contrast to standard forward dynamics models that predict a full next state, value equivalent models are trained to predict a future value, thereby emphasizing value relevant information in the representations. While value equivalent models have shown strong empirical success, there is no research yet that visualizes and investigates what types of representations these models actually learn. Therefore, in this paper we visualize the latent representation of MuZero agents. We find that action trajectories may diverge between observation embeddings and internal state transition dynamics, which could lead to instability during planning. Based on this insight, we propose two regularization techniques to stabilize MuZero's performance. Additionally, we provide an open-source implementation of MuZero along with an interactive visualizer of learned representations, which may aid further investigation of value equivalent algorithms.},

However, Web traversal patterns obtained by traditional Web usage mining approaches are ineffective for the content management of websites. They do not provide the big picture of the intentions of the visitors. The Web navigation patterns, termed throughout-surfing patterns (TSPs) as defined in this paper, are a superset of Web traversal patterns that effectively display the trends toward the next visited Web pages in a browsing session. TSPs are more expressive for understanding the purposes of website visitors. In this paper, we first introduce the concept of throughout-surfing patterns and then present an efficient method for mining the patterns. We propose a compact graph structure, termed a path traversal graph, to record information about the navigation paths of website visitors. The graph contains the frequent surfing paths that are required for mining TSPs. In addition, we devised a graph traverse algorithm based on the proposed graph structure to discover the TSPs. The experimental results show the proposed mining method is highly efficient to discover TSPs.},

This paper develops a unified theoretical framework to analyse three existing linear belief compression approaches, including value-directed compression and two non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF) based algorithms. The results indicate that all the three known belief compression methods have their own critical deficiencies. Therefore, projective NMF belief compression is proposed (P-NMF), aiming to overcome the drawbacks of the existing techniques. The performance of the proposed algorithm is examined on four POMDP problems of reasonably large scale, in comparison with existing techniques. Additionally, the competitiveness of belief compression is compared empirically to a state-of-the-art heuristic search based POMDP solver and their relative merits in solving large-scale POMDPs are investigated.},

Time-dependent parking space availability is considered as the system state, while the dynamic price of parking is naturally used as the control input which can be properly chosen by the parking garage operators from the admissible set. By regulating parking rates, the total demand for parking can be distributed among the set of parking lots under question. Further, we formulate an optimal control problem (called Bolza problem) with the objective of maintaining the availability (managing the demand) of each parking garage at a desired level, which could potentially reduce traffic congestion as well as fuel consumption of CAVs. Based on the necessary conditions of optimality given by Pontryagin’s minimum principle (PMP), we develop a computational algorithm to address the nonlinear optimization problem and formally prove its convergence. A series of Monte Carlo simulations is conducted under various scenarios and the corresponding optimization problems are solved determining the optimal pricing policy for each parking lot. Since the stochastic dynamic model is general and the control inputs, i.e., parking rates, are easy to implement, it is believed that the procedures presented here will shed light on the parking management of CAVs in the near future.},

  abstract = {With promising benefits such as emission reduction, traffic congestion alleviation and parking space saving, electric vehicle sharing systems have attracted increasing attentions. This paper proposes a Trip Pricing Scheme (TPS) for a large-scale EV-sharing network with Shared Electric Vehicle (SEV) demand prediction. In the proposed system, the SEV traffic demand is firstly predicted through a model which includes a cascade graph convolutional neural network and a long-short term memory neural network. Based on this, the TPS is modelled as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem, which aims at maximizing the total system profit from EV sharing business. The proposed TPS determines the optimal combination of the two price adjustment levels, which provides incentives to the spatial-temporal distribution of SEVs’ traffic flows to maximize the system’s profit. Numerical simulations are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Section 17.3 introduces the notion of a Walrasian equilibrium, where supply equals demand and market prices are determined by the self-interested behaviour of market participants. Section 17.4 considers the possibility of disequilibrium and Walrasian âtonnement as a price-adjustment process in an otherwise stationary economy. Section 17.5 deals with the problem of ‘externalities’, where agents' actions are payoff-relevant to other agents. Sections 17.6 and 17.7 consider strategic interactions between agents, in the presence of complete and incomplete information, respectively. Section 17.8 deals with dynamic pricing issues and Section 17.9 mentions some of the persistent behavioural irregularities that are not well captured by classical price theory. Section 17.10 concludes and provides a number of directions from which further research contributions may be expected.},

  abstract = {Instant delivery services, such as food delivery and package delivery, have achieved explosive growth in recent years by providing customers with daily-life convenience. An emerging research area within these services is service Route\&Time Prediction (RTP), which aims to estimate the future service route as well as the arrival time of a given worker. As one of the most crucial tasks in those service platforms, RTP stands central to enhancing user satisfaction and trimming operational expenditures on these platforms. Despite a plethora of algorithms developed to date, there is no systematic, comprehensive survey to guide researchers in this domain. To fill this gap, our work presents the first comprehensive survey that methodically categorizes recent advances in service route and time prediction. We start by defining the RTP challenge and then delve into the metrics that are often employed. Following that, we scrutinize the existing RTP methodologies, presenting a novel taxonomy of them. We categorize these methods based on three criteria: (i) type of task, subdivided into only-route prediction, only-time prediction, and joint route\&time prediction; (ii) model architecture, which encompasses sequence-based and graph-based models; and (iii) learning paradigm, including Supervised Learning (SL) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). Conclusively, we highlight the limitations of current research and suggest prospective avenues. We believe that the taxonomy, progress, and prospects introduced in this paper can significantly promote the development of this field.},

  abstract = {We study synthesis problems with constraints in partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs), where the objective is to compute a strategy for an agent that is guaranteed to satisfy certain safety and performance specifications. Verification and strategy synthesis for POMDPs are, however, computationally intractable in general. We alleviate this difficulty by focusing on planning applications and exploiting typical structural properties of such scenarios; for instance, we assume that the agent has the ability to observe its own position inside an environment. We propose an abstraction refinement framework which turns such a POMDP model into a (fully observable) probabilistic two-player game (PG). For the obtained PGs, efficient verification and synthesis tools allow to determine strategies with optimal safety and performance measures, which approximate optimal schedulers on the POMDP. If the approximation is too coarse to satisfy the given specifications, an refinement scheme improves the computed strategies. As a running example, we use planning problems where an agent moves inside an environment with randomly moving obstacles and restricted observability. We demonstrate that the proposed method advances the state of the art by solving problems several orders-of-magnitude larger than those that can be handled by existing POMDP solvers. Furthermore, this method gives guarantees on safety constraints, which is not supported by the majority of the existing solvers.},

  abstract = {The phrase “dynamic pricing” has entered the airline revenue management lexicon in recent years with the emergence of new distribution capabilities that could allow airlines to adjust ticket prices more frequently. Yet each airline, vendor, and academic has a unique (and often incongruous) view of what dynamic pricing encompasses. To date, there has not been a definition of dynamic pricing proposed in the literature that clearly delineates how these mechanisms are different from traditional airline pricing and revenue management. In this paper, we propose a definitional framework for dynamic pricing for the airline industry. After providing a general definition of dynamic pricing, we describe three mechanisms for price selection—assortment optimization, dynamic price adjustment, and continuous pricing. Depending on the implementation and the information available to the airline at the time of pricing, each of these mechanisms could be used to adjust prices relatively infrequently or, at the limit, on a transaction-by-transaction basis. We close by linking recent technological developments in airline pricing, revenue management, and distribution to the three mechanisms introduced in the framework.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a new approach to the optimal allocation of airline seats among itineraries in a network under stochastic demand. Current approaches to network seat inventory control are based on either full assignment or bucket control. Under full assignment, all seats on each flight leg are assigned to a specific single- or multi-leg itinerary. Under bucket control seats are assigned to groups of itineraries. The flexible assignment approach proposed in this paper assigns some seats exclusively to each single- or multi-leg itinerary as in fixed assignment and assigns the remaining seats to groups of itineraries as in bucket control. This paper formulates the flexible assignment approach, develops rules for optimal assignment for a single-fare-class network and proves the superiority of this approach to either fixed assignment or bucket control. A numerical simulation is ised to illustrate the differences in expected revenue among these three methods of seat inventory control for four different demand scenarios.},

  abstract = {To solve tasks in complex environments, robots need to learn from experience. Deep reinforcement learning is a common approach to robot learning but requires a large amount of trial and error to learn, limiting its deployment in the physical world. As a consequence, many advances in robot learning rely on simulators. On the other hand, learning inside of simulators fails to capture the complexity of the real world, is prone to simulator inaccuracies, and the resulting behaviors do not adapt to changes in the world. The Dreamer algorithm has recently shown great promise for learning from small amounts of interaction by planning within a learned world model, outperforming pure reinforcement learning in video games. Learning a world model to predict the outcomes of potential actions enables planning in imagination, reducing the amount of trial and error needed in the real environment. However, it is unknown whether Dreamer can facilitate faster learning on physical robots. In this paper, we apply Dreamer to 4 robots to learn online and directly in the real world, without any simulators. Dreamer trains a quadruped robot to roll off its back, stand up, and walk from scratch and without resets in only 1 hour. We then push the robot and find that Dreamer adapts within 10 minutes to withstand perturbations or quickly roll over and stand back up. On two different robotic arms, Dreamer learns to pick and place objects from camera images and sparse rewards, approaching human-level teleoperation performance. On a wheeled robot, Dreamer learns to navigate to a goal position purely from camera images, automatically resolving ambiguity about the robot orientation. Using the same hyperparameters across all experiments, we find that Dreamer is capable of online learning in the real world, which establishes a strong baseline. We release our infrastructure for future applications of world models to robot learning.},

  abstract = {Electric vehicles (EVs) endow great potentials for future transportation systems, while efficient charge scheduling strategies are crucial for improving profits and mass adoption of EVs. Two critical and open issues concerning EV charging are how to minimize the total charging cost (Objective 1) and how to minimize the peak load (Objective 2). Although extensive efforts have been made to model EV charging problems, little information is available about model properties and efficient algorithms for dynamic charging problems. This paper aims to fill these gaps. For Objective 1, we demonstrate that the greedy-choice property applies, which means that a globally optimal solution can be achieved by making locally optimal greedy choices, whereas it does not apply to Objective 2. We propose a non-myopic charging strategy accounting for future demands to achieve global optimality for Objective 2. The problem is addressed by a heuristic algorithm combining a multi-commodity network flow model with customized bisection search algorithm in a rolling horizon framework. To expedite the solution efficiency, we derive the upper bound and lower bound in the bisection search based on the relationship between charging volume and parking time. We also explore the impact of demand levels and peak arrival ratios on the system performance. Results show that with prediction, the peak load can converge to a globally optimal solution, and that an optimal look-ahead time exists beyond which any prediction is ineffective. The proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms, and is robust to the variations of demand and peak arrival ratios.},

Gibson is based on virtualizing real spaces, rather than using artificially designed ones, and currently includes over 1400 floor spaces from 572 full buildings.

  abstract = {Standard exploration methods typically rely on random coverage of the state space or coverage-promoting exploration bonuses. However, in partially observed settings, the biggest exploration challenge is often posed by the need to discover information-gathering strategies---e.g., an agent that has to navigate to a location in traffic might learn to first check traffic conditions and then choose a route. In this work, we design a POMDP agent that gathers information about the hidden state, using ideas from the meta-exploration literature. Our approach provides an exploration bonus that rewards the agent for gathering information about the state that is relevant for completing the task. While this requires the agent to know what this information is during training, it can obtained in several ways: in the most general case, off-policy algorithms can leverage knowledge about the entire trajectory to determine such information in hindsight, but the user can also provide prior knowledge (e.g., privileged information) to help inform the training process. Through experiments in several partially-observed environments, we find that our approach is competitive with prior methods when minimal exploration is needed, but substantially outperforms them when more complex strategies are required. Our algorithm also shows the ability to learn without any privileged information, by reasoning about the entire trajectory in hindsight and and effectively using any information it reveals about the hidden state.},

  abstract = {To reduce the air pollution and improve the energy efficiency, many countries and cities (e.g., Singapore) are on the way of introducing electric vehicles (EVs) to replace the vehicles serving in current traffic system. Effective placement of charging stations is essential for the rapid development of EVs, because it is necessary for providing convenience for EVs and ensuring the efficiency of the traffic network. However, existing works mostly concentrate on the mileage anxiety from EV users but ignore their strategic and competitive charging behaviors. To capture the competitive and strategic charging behaviors of the EV users, we consider that an EV user’s charging cost, which is dependent on other EV users’ choices, consists of the travel cost to access the charging station and the queuing cost in charging stations. First, we formulate the Charging Station Placement Problem (CSPP) as a bilevel optimization problem. Then, by exploiting the equilibrium of the EV charging game, we convert the bilevel optimization problem to a single-level one, following which we analyze the properties of CSPP and propose an algorithm Optimizing eleCtric vEhicle chArging statioN (OCEAN) to compute the optimal allocation of charging stations. Due to OCEAN’s scalability issue, we furthermore present a heuristic algorithm OCEAN with Continuous variables to deal with large-scale real-world problems. Finally, we demonstrate and discuss the results of the extensive experiments we did. It is shown that our approach outperform baseline methods significantly.},

In this case, an agent cannot observe the true state of the environment and perceive different states to be the same. Our proposed method uses the agent’s time-series information to deal with this imperfect perception problem. In particular, the proposed method uses reservoir computing to transform the time-series of observation information into a non-linear state. A typical model of reservoir computing, the echo state network (ESN), transforms raw observations into reservoir states. The proposed method is named dual ESNs reinforcement learning, which uses two ESNs specialized for observation and action information. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method in environments where imperfect perception problems occur.},

A large class of POMDP algorithms follows a two-step approach, in which the first step is to estimate the belief state, and the second step is to solve for the optimal policy taking the belief state as input. The optimality guarantee of their combination relies on the so-called separation principle. In this paper, we propose a new path to prove the separation principle for infinite horizon general POMDP problems under both discounted cost and average cost. We use a nominal horizon to split a virtual objective function into two parts and prove that it converges to the optimal state-value function. Based on the separation principle, we design a two-step POMDP algorithm called Belief State Actor-Critic (BSAC), which first estimates the belief state and then takes it as input to solve for the optimal policy. The belief state is learned using variational inference, and the policy is learned through model-based reinforcement learning. We test our algorithm in a partially observable multi-lane autonomous driving task. Results show that our algorithm achieves lower costs than the baselines and learns safe, efficient, and smooth driving behaviors.},

Time-of-use (TOU) pricing has been proposed as a demand-side management (DSM) method to influence user demands. In this paper, we describe a game-theoretic approach to optimize TOU pricing strategies (GT-TOU). We propose models of costs to utility companies arising from user demand fluctuations, and models of user satisfaction with the difference between the nominal demand and the actual consumption. We design utility functions for the company and the users, and obtain a Nash equilibrium using backward induction. In addition to a single-user-type scenario, we also consider a scenario with multiple types of users, each of whom responds differently to time-dependent prices. Numerical examples show that our method is effective in leveling the user demand by setting optimal TOU prices, potentially decreasing costs for the utility companies, and increasing user benefits. An increase in social welfare measure indicates improved market efficiency through TOU pricing.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the scheduling problem of a fleet of electric vehicles, providing mobility as a service to a set of time-specified customers, where the operator needs to solve the routing and charging problem jointly for each EV. We consider incentive-aware customers and propose that the operator offers monetary incentives to customers in exchange for time flexibility. In this way, the fleet operator can arrive at a routing and charging schedule with lower costs, whilst the customers receive monetary compensation for their flexibility. Specifically, we first propose a bi-level optimization model whereby the fleet operator optimizes the routing and charging schedule accounting for the spatio-temporal varying charging price, jointly with a monetary incentive to reimburse the delivery time flexibility experienced by the customers. Concurrently the customers choose their own time flexibility by minimizing their cost. Second, we cope with the computational burden coming from this nonlinear bi-level optimization model with an accurate reformulation approach consisting of the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions, a Big-M-based linearization method, and the zero duality gap of convex optimization problems. We thus convert the proposed problem into a single-level optimization problem, which can be solved by a strengthened generalized Benders decomposition method holding a faster convergence rate than the classic generalized Benders decomposition method. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed mathematical model, we carry out numerous simulation experiments by using the VRP-REP data of Belgium. The numerical results showcase that the proposed mathematical model can reduce the delivery fees for the customers together with the cost of operation incurred by the fleet operator.},

This work deals with these two problems by only using the pricing policy.

With the development of mobile Internet and position technologies, it is reasonable to collect spatio-temporal data and then leverage these data to achieve the goal of intelligent transportation, and here, traffic prediction plays an important role. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on traffic prediction, which is from the spatio-temporal data layer to the intelligent transportation application layer. At first, we split the whole research scope into four parts from bottom to up, where the four parts are, respectively, spatio-temporal data, preprocessing, traffic prediction and traffic application. Later, we review existing work on the four parts. First, we summarize traffic data into five types according to their difference on spatial and temporal dimensions. Second, we focus on four significant data preprocessing techniques: map-matching, data cleaning, data storage and data compression. Third, we focus on three kinds of traffic prediction problems (i.e., classification, generation and estimation/forecasting). In particular, we summarize the challenges and discuss how existing methods address these challenges. Fourth, we list five typical traffic applications. Lastly, we provide emerging research challenges and opportunities. We believe that the survey can help the partitioners to understand existing traffic prediction problems and methods, which can further encourage them to solve their intelligent transportation applications.},

In this paper, we focus on the EV public charging market with heterogeneous charging stations (CSs) under the time-based billing model. We jointly consider the charging time optimization for EVs, the EV-CS pairing, and the pricing mechanism for CSs. A hierarchical game, which mathematically corresponds to an equilibrium problem with equilibrium constraints (EPEC), is then developed to formulate the three coupled problems. In the proposed hierarchical game, each CS sets the charging price to maximize its own revenue first, then the EVs choose their desired CSs and determine the charging time. We analyze the optimal charging time strategies for EVs, and a many-to-one matching algorithm is applied to solve the EV-CS pairing problem. Besides, a block coordinate descent (BCD) based algorithm is applied for each CS to solve the pricing problem. Simulation results show that our proposed schemes can achieve the performance improvement of the charging system.},

The key idea is to quantize each extracted key point into one of visual words, and then represent each image by a histogram of the visual words. For this purpose, a clustering algorithm (e.g., K-means), is generally used for generating the visual words. Although a number of studies have shown encouraging results of the bag-of-words representation for object categorization, theoretical studies on properties of the bag-of-words model is almost untouched, possibly due to the difficulty introduced by using a heuristic clustering process. In this paper, we present a statistical framework which generalizes the bag-of-words representation. In this framework, the visual words are generated by a statistical process rather than using a clustering algorithm, while the empirical performance is competitive to clustering-based method. A theoretical analysis based on statistical consistency is presented for the proposed framework. Moreover, based on the framework we developed two algorithms which do not rely on clustering, while achieving competitive performance in object categorization when compared to clustering-based bag-of-words representations.},

The charging station is equipped with renewable energy generation devices and can also buy energy from power grids. The uncertainty of the arrival of the EV, the intermittence of the renewable energy, and the variation of the grid power price are taken into account and described as independent Markov processes. Meanwhile, the required charging energy for each EV is random. The goal is to minimize the mean waiting time for EVs under the long-term constraint on the cost. We propose queue mapping to convert the EV queue to the charging demand queue, and we prove the equivalence between the minimization of the two queues' average length. Then, we focus on the minimization for the average length of the charging demand queue under the long-term cost constraint. We propose a framework of Markov decision process (MDP) to investigate this constrained stochastic optimization problem. The system state includes the charging demand queue length, the charging demand arrival, the energy level in the storage battery of the renewable energy, the renewable energy arrival, and the grid power price. Additionally, the number of charging demands and the allocated energy from the storage battery compose the 2-D policy. We derive two necessary conditions of the optimal policy. Moreover, we discuss the reduction of the 2-D policy to be the number of charging demands only. We give the sets of system states for which charging no demand and charging as many demands as possible are optimal, respectively. Finally, we investigate the proposed policies numerically.},

This paper investigates the coordinated charging of multiple EVs with the aim of reducing the charging cost, ensuring a high battery state of charge (SoC), and avoiding the transformer overload. To this end, we first formulate the EV coordinated charging problem with the above multiple objectives as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and then propose a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithm. In the proposed algorithm, a novel interaction model, i.e., communication neural network (CommNet) model, is adopted to realize the distributed computation of global information (namely the electricity price, the transformer load, and the total charging cost of multiple EVs). Moreover, different from the most existing works which make specific constraints on the size, the location, or the topology of the distribution network, what we need in the proposed method is only the transformer load. Besides, due to the use of long and short-term memory (LSTM) for price prediction, the proposed algorithm can flexibly deal with various uncertain price mechanisms. Finally, simulations are presented to verify the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed algorithm in a residential charging area.},

  abstract = {Dynamic pricing for network revenue management has received considerable attention in research and practice. Based on data obtained from a major hotel, we use a large-scale numerical study to compare the performance of several heuristic approaches proposed in the literature. The heuristic approaches we consider include deterministic linear programming with resolving and three variants of dynamic programming decomposition. Dynamic programming decomposition is considered one of the strongest heuristics and is the method chosen in some recent commercial implementations, and remains a topic of research in the recent academic literature. In addition to a plain-vanilla implementation of dynamic programming decomposition, we consider two variants proposed in recent literature. For the base scenario generated from the real data, we show that the method based on Zhang (2011) [An improved dynamic programming decomposition approach for network revenue management. Manufacturing Service Oper. Management 13(1):35–52.] leads to a small but significant lift in revenue compared with all other approaches. We generate many alternative problem scenarios by varying capacity-demand ratio and network structure and show that the performance of the different heuristics can be strongly influenced by both. Overall, our paper shows the promise of some recent proposals in the academic literature but also offers a cautionary tale on the choice of heuristic methods for practical network pricing problems.},

  abstract = {With the increasing penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) and various user preferences, charging stations often provide several different charging modes to satisfy the various requirements of EVs. How to effectively utilize the charging capacity to minimize the service dropping rate is a pressing and open issue for charging stations. Given that EV owners are price-sensitive to the charging modes, we intend to design an optimal pricing scheme to minimize the service dropping rate of the charging station. First, we formulate the operation of a dual-mode charging station as a queuing network with multiple servers and heterogeneous service rates, and analyze the relationship between the service dropping rate of the charging station and the selections of EVs. Then, we formulate a customer attrition minimization problem to minimize the number of EVs that leave the charging station without being charged and propose an optimal pricing approach to guide and coordinate the charging processes of EVs in the charging station. The simulation has been conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed charging scheduling scheme and show the efficiency of the proposed pricing scheme.},

  abstract = {Due to the increasing number of electric vehicles and limited charging stations, charging service providers need to consider the minimum range of electric vehicles and the congestion level of charging stations to formulate pricing strategies and guide charging vehicles. However, this service faces the challenges of privacy protection and utility coupling between CSs and EVs. Besides, the minimum driving range is also affected by the time-varying data characteristics of vehicles. Therefore, this paper proposes an FL-assisted stable charging matching strategy considering congestion factors and range constraints. Specifically, we employ a federated learning scheme to predict the congestion factor of each charging station by learning the complex hidden characteristics of vehicles under the condition of privacy protection. Then, the pricing strategy and utility function are updated based on the congestion factor. Furthermore, under the driving range constraint, we transform the impact of the congestion factor on the expected utility into a regret value and use the Gale-Shapley algorithm based on regret minimization to achieve stable matching between vehicles and charging stations. Experimental results demonstrate the scheme’s effectiveness and that the charging success rate is improved by up to 11.7\% compared with mainstream methods.},

However, most existing network visualization techniques provide limited support for the comprehension of network concepts. This research proposes an approach called concept visualization to facilitate the understanding of social network concepts. The paper describes an implementation of the approach. Results from a controlled laboratory experiment indicate that, compared with the benchmark system, the NetVizer system facilitated better understanding of the concepts of betweenness centrality, gatekeepers of subgroups, and structural similarity. It also supported a faster comprehension of subgroup identification.},

  abstract = {Load forecasting is one of the major challenges of power system operation and is crucial to the effective scheduling for economic dispatch at multiple time scales. Numerous load forecasting methods have been proposed for household and commercial demand, as well as for loads at various nodes in a power grid. However, compared with conventional loads, the uncoordinated charging of the large penetration of plug-in electric vehicles is different in terms of periodicity and fluctuation, which renders current load forecasting techniques ineffective. Deep learning methods, empowered by unprecedented learning ability from extensive data, provide novel approaches for solving challenging forecasting tasks. This research proposes a comparative study of deep learning approaches to forecast the super-short-term stochastic charging load of plug-in electric vehicles. Several popular and novel deep-learning based methods have been utilized in establishing the forecasting models using minute-level real-world data of a plug-in electric vehicle charging station to compare the forecasting performance. Numerical results of twelve cases on various time steps show that deep learning methods obtain high accuracy in super-short-term plug-in electric load forecasting. Among the various deep learning approaches, the long-short-term memory method performs the best by reducing over 30\% forecasting error compared with the conventional artificial neural network model.},
